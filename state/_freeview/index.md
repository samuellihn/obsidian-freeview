Hello! I'm Samuel Lihn, a first-year Mechanical Engineering student at Johns Hopkins University. Welcome to my notes website! Here, you'll find every note I've ever taken in the last few years, with few exceptions.

Here are my current classes:
- Linear Algebra and Differential Equations: [[553.291 Linear Algebra and Differential Equations MOC]]
- Data Structures
- Introduction to Sociology
- Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design and CAD
- Elements of Microeconomics

Past classes:
- Linear Algebra: [[Linear Algebra MOC]]
- Calculus 3: [[Calculus 3 MOC]]
- AP Environmental Science: [[AP Environmental Science MOC]]
- AP Calculus BC (All topics): [[AP Calculus BC MOC]]
- AP Physics 1 Algebra-based: [[AP Physics 1 MOC]]
- AP Physics E&M: [[AP Physics EM MOC]]

> Note: Some links don't exist - this is a byproduct of my note taking procedure. Eventually, I'll implement a system to differentiate nonexistent documents from those that do link to things.

> Note: This website isn't perfect. Sometimes things will 404, render improperly, or other weirdness may occur. The system I use to compile these notes from my Obsidian vault is open source, if you'd like to use and modify it for your own purposes: [https://github.com/samuellihn/obsidian-freeview](https://github.com/samuellihn/obsidian-freeview)
