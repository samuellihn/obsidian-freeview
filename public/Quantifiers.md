## Universal Quantifier
$\forall$ means "for all"

"For any real number $x$, $x^2$ is non-negative"

$$\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, x^2 \geq 0$$

## Existential Quantifier

$\exists$ means "exists"

"There is a real number whose square is 2"

$$\exists x \in \mathbb{R} \ such \ that \ x^2 = 2$$

# Negating Qualifiers

You can use the negation [[Logical Connectives]] to negate a statement

$$\neg \left[\forall x \in U, p(x)\right] \equiv \exists x \in \mathbb{R} \ such \ that \ \neg p(x)$$

"Everyone in this school is a genius"

> Find one person in this school that is not a genius

$$\neg \left[\exists x \in U, p(x)\right] \equiv \forall x \in \mathbb{R} \ such \ that \ \neg p(x)$$

"There exists an imposter among us"

> Verify that everyone among us is not an imposter
