If a number is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, the function has both a local minimum and maximum on that interval

Do not assume two endpoints are the min and max!

Minimum and maximum **value** exists, but this value can occur at multiple values of $x$
> The minimum and maximum values can even be the same 

Minimum means that $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for all $x$
Maximum means that $f(c) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$

If you know that the point is a relative min/max and is the opposite of what you are trying to find the absolute is, you can skip it (If I'm finding the relative min, I will not need to test relative maxes because they will never be absolute minima)

Need to find [[Critical Points]] to use this theorem
