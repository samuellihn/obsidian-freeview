# Peace through Strength
19.3.1

Reagan thought detente was not useful and the U. S. should start whittling away at Soviet control of Eastern Europe. Believed that peace should come through military strength

Believed U. S. should challenge communism as much as possible without provoking war by toppling communist nations

Largest peacetime military buildup in U. S. history, billions of dollars to build B1 and B2 bombers, MX missiles, placed new nuclear missiles in Europe despite growing trend of denuclearization

Believed he could outspend Soveit Union and win

**Strategic defense initiative** would place lasers on land and space to shoot down missiles headed for the United States, heavily mocked, named "Star Wars", people thought it was unrealistic

**Supported anticommunist rebellions globally**, funded and trained **mijahadeen**, anti-soviet rebels in Afghanistan, Soviet forces began to withdraw in 1988 (it worked)

Backed anticommunist counter-revolutionaries (**Contras**) in Nicaragua, supported right-wing gov't in El Salvador that was battling leftist rebels

> Recieved criticism from human rights activists, so Congress made funding for El Salvador gov't dependent on nation's human rights progress

U. S. troops invaded Grenada in 1983 to prevent communist movement, despite questionable legal grounds. Most Americans approved.

Gorbachev becomes president of Soviet Union in 1985, created policy of new openness and Soviet Reform, move away from socialist economy. Shifted relations with U. S. because of reform. Reforms were by Soviet Union's failed and stagnant economy, food shortages, etc.

Reagan responded by taking more moderate stance toward Soviet Union. Met four times from 1985-89, held joint press conference at last meeting. Relations were warmed up between Reagan and Gorbachev.

Soviet Union and U. S. sighed nuclear arms pact, begun negotiations on START 1 to reduce nuclear weapons

# End of Cold War
19.3.2

Cold War came to end in 1991 as Soviet Union fell. Berlin wall tore down, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary held democratic elections. Many communist governments fell in Eastern europe. 

Germany was united as a single nation as Berlin wall was opened. 

Communist rule was not maintained in Soviet Union, most Russians supported Gorbachev, then the communist party lost power and seperated into 15 republics. Many say that Gorbachev's openness allowed rebellion to rise out of control, communist rule could only be contained by rigid control, not openness

Reagan did contribute to ending the cold war, American arms buildup made Soviet economy seem weaker and fall faster, prompting Gorbachev to promote reform which eventually led to the fall of the Soviet Union

# Involvement in Middle East
19.3.3

U. S. clashed wtih Libya in 1980s, used to be good trading partners but relations fell apart as the leader (Qaddafi) supported terrorist groups, U. S. placed sanctions on Libya.

April 1986, U. S. warplanes bombed Libya after a terrorist attack on a Berlin nightclub. Air raid killed Qaddafi's family member, his criticism of U. S. decreased. Tensions remained.

Reagan sent 800 Marines to Lebanon to try to make the nation peaceful after many years of civil war. Truck loaded with explosives drove into the headquarters of Marines in Beirut, killed 241 marines. Reagan withdrew the remaining marines, showed how dangerous and complicated Middle Eastern policies were.

Iran released all hostages 20 minutes after Reagan took oath of office, but Iran-contra affair did harm his reputation in his second term

U. S. sold weapons to Iran and Iran would promise to pressure terrorist groups in Lebanon to release American hostages. Did not work, violated administration's policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists. 

Then, the money from the sale was used to fund the Contras in nicaragua, despite Congress banning this in 1983. Many leading administration officials were convicted because of the scandal, Reagan's reputation was diminished but still left office with high ratings.
