# Experiment

**Controlled Experiment** - controlling all variables and factors within the experiment

> Can't control everything, but at least the significant factors are under some amount of regulation

Control group - normal conditions
Experimental group - exposed to experimental factor
Experimental factor -> independent variable

# Results 

Emperical evidence is **observed**

Can either be qualitative or quantitative, abstract observations vs. concrete numbers

> One is not "better" than the other - some data can only be observed in one way, different inferences from each


# Theory

Widely accepted, everyone agrees upon it
