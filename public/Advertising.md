Advertising is a method used to attract buyers in [[Monopolistic Competition]]

Critique - advertising is used to manipulate people's tastes, creating desires that may not already exist

Defense - firms use advertising to provide information to customers so they make better choices when being a consumer, and fosters competition due to information about all market players

> In some cases, advertising may signal to consumers that a product is of high quality as it is "worth the cost" to advertise - the profits it thinks it will make are higher the cost it takes to advertise


Brand names are closely related to advertising - once a company builds up an image of itself through advertising or market dominance, it has an incentive to maintain its level of quality and reputation
