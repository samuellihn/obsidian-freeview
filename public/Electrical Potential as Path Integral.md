 $$V_{ab} = \int_a^b{\vec{E} \cdot \vec{dr}}$$

> $\vec{E}$ is different at every single $dr$, as we move closer to/farther from charges

 Divide the path from point A to B into infinitely small segments, and add up the electric field at each of them
 > How much force is exerted at each point to bring the particle to this position?

Again, if electric field and path are parallel, take out the dot product
 
> Usually simplified with either uniform field so we can pull $E$ out of the integral

Sometimes it may be necesary to split the integral into parts where $E$ can be removed from the integral
