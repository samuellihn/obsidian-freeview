The total kinetic energy of a mass that is both rotating and translating is defined as the sum of their [[Linear Kinetic Energy]] and [[Rotational Kinetic Energy]]

$$
KE_T = KE_l + KE_r
$$

$$
KE_T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2
$$

From there, the velocity of rolling objects can be derived (msas and radius will cancel)

Most square plates and rods will not roll, so their velocities can be determined with their [[Linear Kinetic Energy]]
