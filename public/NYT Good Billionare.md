"Good billionaire" myth - philanthropic billionaires are unproblematic

Their wealth is due to the system they occupy, and the flaws with the system is that it is functioning as intended - people are taxed on their income, not on their wealth

They use philanthropy as their excuse out of criticism

Accruing so much wealth is not conducive to a one-person one-vote democracy, as it gives people with money an undue influence over public life
