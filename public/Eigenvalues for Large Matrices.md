If a matrix is in triangular form (see [[Matrix Terms]]), the eigenvalues for the matrix are its entries on its main diagonal

> Closely related to [[Properties of Determinants]]
> If the matrix is not **originally** in triangular form, we cannot use this

For a matrix larger than $2 \times 2$, we will get cubic [[Characteristic Equation]], which we cannot solve for easily

However, if one eigenvalue is provided, we know one factor of the polynomial, and we can use [[Polynomial Long Division]] to turn the cubic polynomial into a quadratic polynomial times a linear factor

From there, we can use the regular techniques described in [[Characteristic Equation]]
