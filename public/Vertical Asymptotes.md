Limits can equal infinity and negative infinity

A vertical asymptote is defined as follows:

If $f(x)$ approaches $\infty$ or $-\infty$ as $x$ approaches $c$ from the right or left, the line $x = c$ is a vertical asymptote of the graph of $f(x)$

Limits of infinity mean the limit **does not exist**. However they tell you how the limit fails to exist and it gives information about the behavior of the function

One sided limits equal to positive or negative infinity indicate the location of vertical asymptotes

For rational functions, vertical asymptotes occur **when the denominator equals zero and the numerator is nonzero**

You can identify infinite limits from tabular data by seeing $f(c)$ grow "uncontrollably" as $x \to c$

It is possible to have an infinite limit on only one side of a vertical asymptote

Example: $f(x) = \ln(x+2)$

```desmos-graph
f(x) = \ln(x+2)
```

> **A function can still be defined at a vertical asymptote!**
