Euler's method uses successive [[Linearization]] to estimate a function, by linearizing using the slope provided in the differential equation at different "steps"

Create a table with x, y, $\frac{dy}{dx}$, equation of the tangent line, and the new y (as determined by the step size)

Finer resolution gives more accurate answer

Make sure to properly define $\Delta{x}$

Euler's method gives different answers depending on whether we are working backwards or forwards
