The **equilibrium point** is where [[Law of Supply|supply]] and [[Law of Demand|demand]] curves intersect

$$
Q_D = Q_s\  \text{and}\  P_D = P_S
$$

$P$ is called the **market clearing price**, where there is no surplus or shortage  of goods

The equilibrium point is a **static point** - will not move unless something changes
