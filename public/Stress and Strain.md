In the case of **uniaxial tension**, the **stress** an object experiences is defined as:

$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A_0}
$$
This is called the **Engineering normal stress**

Units of $\frac{\text{Force}}{\text{Area}}$

> Does not account for area getting smaller as more tension is applied
> "normal" = force is perpendicular to plane of area

The lengthening of an object under stress is called **strain**, defined as:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}
$$

This is called the **engineering normal strain**

Stress and strain typically exhibit a **linear relationship**
