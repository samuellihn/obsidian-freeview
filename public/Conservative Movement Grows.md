1980 - back to conversation about economic systems

# Liberals and Conservatives Diverge
19.1.1

Liberals favored government intervention to help the needy, where conservatives favored free market, private organizations, and individual goodwill to help the needy

After Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat, conservatives clearly defined goals and values so they could win in the future

Goldwater returned to the Senate and found support from California Governor Ronald Reagan

**Reagan was elected president in 1980 and began a new conservative movement**

Viewpoints:
Liberals | Conservatives
---|---
Gov't should play significant role to improve lives of all Americans | Large gov't put economic growth in danger, stifled individual choice
Valued social programs for poor, elderly, unemployed | Felt social programs left rising inflation and waste
Legislation to protect minorities, women | Wanted to keep "traditional values"
Gov't regulation of industry | Reduce taxes and limit regulation to promote economic growth
Cooperation with int'l organizations like UN | Strong anti-communist stance, fighting using our own resources

**Economic Conservatives** wanted a freer market and less government regulation to further promote economic growth

**Neoconservatives/traditionalists** warned that abandoning traditional values was bad, new freedoms (counterculture, mass culture) and new concern with social issues conflicted directly with many conservatives' religious beliefs

**Anticommunist conservatives** focused on the dangers of Soviet Union, did not agree with Ford/Nixon's detente policy, fought against SALT II (from Carter)

# "New Right" becomes popular
19.1.2

Republicans and Democrats were starting to become divided again now that the Cold War was less prevalent and the world wasn't going to blow up 

> Unification in 40s and 50s, separation in 60s and 70s (and onward)

Difference between political parties became more pronounced

**New Right** - new conservative movement, grew rapidly, jointly by different types of conseravatives

Democratic party was also falling apart, as Johnson's policies on Vietnam divided the country

- Counterculture aliented souther denocrats and white conservative Chrsitians
- Feminist movement was opposed by conservative Democrat social leaders
- Oil crisis, hostage crisis weakened public trust in gov't (and Democrats)
- Economy stagnated because of programs like Great Society, social programs lost appeal

**Economic Conservatives** believed liberal policies were respnosible for stagflation. Complained about heavy taxes, high gov't spending, **unfunded mandates** (programs required but not paid for by federal gov't)

Argued federal welfare programs rewarded lack of effort, made poverty worse, bad side effects, affirmative action contributed to reverse discrimination

**Sagebrush Rebels** wanted fed gov't to give land in western states to the states for economic advantage, opposed by environmentalists because the federal lands were mostly preserved/undeveloped

**Religious right** also supported new conservatives, worried about decline of traditioal family, opposed abortion, gay rights, and equal rights. Main group was **Moral Majority**, political organization working to fulfill Christian religious goals

> Moral Majority touched Americans who normally didn't vote, registered 2m new voters in 1980, boosted Republican chances of winning

## Demographic Changes
Many Americans moved to suburbs, taking away from the urban Democrat strongholds, also struggled financially so (expensive) liberalism was getting less popular

Migration from Rust Belt to Sunbelt helped Republicans, (racist) conservatives in Deep South now aligned with Republican views (party switch). Mostly white southerners, right after civil rights legislation was enacted

# Conservatives win

19.1.3

Growing conservative movement allowed Ronald Reagan to win in 1980. Opposed big gov't, supported strong military, had faith in traditional values, was very optimistic

Formerly Hollywood movie actor, was not very famous (important in his consideration for optics during presidency)

Became Goldwater conservative, failed to make Goldwater win but brought the attention of many conservatives. Became California governor in 1966, won election in landslide in 1980 against Jimmy Carter

Election was close until presidential debate, where his communication gifts (incl. from his previous life) showed and he won 50.7% of popular vote and most electoral votes

Republicans also captured Senate, first time since 1955
