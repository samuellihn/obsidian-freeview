The area under a rate of change its its **accumulation of change**

Can be calculated geometrically by breaking up area into rectangles, triangles, and trapezoids
Relates to [[Integrals]]

To find the units, multiply the units of the **rate** by the units of the **independent value**:

$$
\frac{y}{x} * x = y
$$

$$
\frac{miles}{hour} * hour = miles
$$

Accumulation can be negative as well as positive, depends on the rate
You can add two adjacent intervals of change (areas)
