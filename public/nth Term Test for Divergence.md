If the value of a term of a series as n approaches infinity, is nonzero, then the series must diverge.
However, if it is zero, the series **may** diverge

If 
$$\lim_{n \to \infty} {a_n} \neq 0$$
Then the series **will** diverge

However, if:

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} {a_n} = 0$$
The series **may or may not** diverge, and an additional test is needed
