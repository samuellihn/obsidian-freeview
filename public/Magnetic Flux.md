Each field, [[Gravitational Field]], [[Electric Field]], and Magnetic field has a flux ([[Electric Flux]], etc.)

For magnetic fields, the flux can be expressed as:

$$
\phi_B = \int{\vec{B} \cdot \vec{dA}}
$$

Flux is the amount of field lines that go through a particular flat surface

In this case, $A$ is the area within a Faradian loop

The flux going through the first surface will be the greatest because the [[Surface Normal]]s are the most parallel to the magnetic field (because of the dot product)

Again, try to model uniformity when doing these problems. The magnetic field will almost always be uniform.

We can also express this as 

$$
\phi_B = \int{\vec{B}\vec{dA}} \cos\theta
$$

Magnetic flux is expressed as $\phi$, which has the units Tesla-sq. meters ($T \cdot m^2$), or **Webers**

The total magnetic flux enclosed by a Gaussian surface will always be zero, which is useful for solving certain problems.

Just like with [[Electric Flux]], each field line that goes in needs to go out, and because of the vector nature of magnetic flux, the in and out products will cancel each other out

However, magnetic field lines are circular, so they **must** enter and reenter the [[Gaussian Surfaces|closed Gaussian surface]]. Therefore, the flux will cancel out for everything, even enclosed magnetic fields.

This is why each magnet has two poles, the magneticl field lines never end

if we break a magnetic in half it forms two smaller bipolar magnets

Because of this bipolar nature of magnetic field lines, the integral

$$
\oint{\vec{B} \cdot \vec{dA}}
$$

Always equals zero a given closed Gaussian surface.

$$
\oint{\vec{B} \cdot \vec{dA}} = 0
$$
