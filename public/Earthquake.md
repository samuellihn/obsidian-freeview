A **seismic wave** is the energy released from an earthquake - they travel in different directions from the center of the earthquake

Magnitude measured on Richter Scale - every step is ten times greater

The focus is the area **under the earth's surface** where the earthquake begins

> Where the rocks or plates move for the first time

Epicenter - area directly above the focus, where the strongest shaking occurs

Major earthquake zones:
- Ring of Fire
- Alaska's Western coastline
- California's Western coastline (San Andreas Fault)
