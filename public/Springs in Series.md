When springs are in series, the equivalent [[Spring Force|spring constant]] is:

$$
\frac{1}{k_{eq}} = \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{k_n}
$$

> Very similar to [[Resistors in Parallel]]

Or, equivalently

$$
k_{eq} = \frac{k_1 \times k_2 \times \dots \times k_n}{ k_1 + k_2 + \dots + k_n}
$$
