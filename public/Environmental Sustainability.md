**Sustainability** - using resources at a rate without depleting/degrading functions and properties of the resource

Exponential growth is **incompatible** with sustainable use 

> Sustainable growth isn't an accurate term - eventually there will be enough "growth" that the population overconsumes once again

To achieve sustainability, understanding the **natural capital** (resources) is important

Three main things
- Natural resources support economy/keep us alive
- Ecosystems **depend on** biodiversity
- Ecosystems dispose of wastes and recycle all elements to replenish resources
