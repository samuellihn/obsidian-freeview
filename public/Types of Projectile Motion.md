There are three types of projectile motion:

   
# Falling
Pushed horizontally from higher point and falling in a half-parabola
Initial velocity has no vertical component

# "Jumping"

Going up, reaching an apex (velocity = 0), and falling back down
Full parabola
The initial velocity will have a vertical component

> If given an angle, use trigonometric functions to calculate horizontal and vertical components

# Combination of both

Launched upwards from a higher point

Initial velocity has a vertical and horizontal component, but still starts from a higher point


Use the [[Quadratic Formula]] along with the [[Kinematics Equations#Third Kinematics Equation]] to analyze the motion of the projectile

Find the roots of the parabola, they are when $y = 0$ (the projectile is on the ground!)
