Can be used with both indefinite and definite integrals

# Long division

When we need to integrate a rational function with a greater degree in the numerator, we can polynomial long divide
This will give us a polynomial and a lower-degree rational function that may be easier to integrate (With the [[Integration Rules#Reverse 2 5-Power-Rule Power Rule|RPR]])

The last term will probably integrate into a natural log

# Completing the square

When the integrand involves a quadratic expression, usually in the denominator

Make the constant term of the quadratic equation equal to $\frac{b}{2a}^2$

Then, the quadratic will simplify to $a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2$

Then, we can set $x + \frac{b}{2a}$ to $u$ and u-substitute to get the final answer, often an inverse trig function

 # Partial Fractions
 
 Transform a rational integral with a factorable denominator into the sum of rational functions with a constant-term numerator, so we can turn them into natural logs with [[u Substitution]]
 
Algebraically solve for new numerators by zeroing terms or using a system of equations
