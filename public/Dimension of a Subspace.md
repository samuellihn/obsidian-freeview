The dimension of a subspace $H$, denoted as $dim \  H$, is the number of vectors in any basis $B$, or the number of entries in the [[Coordinates of Subspaces|coordinate vector]] of any point in $H$

> The dimension of the zero subspace ${0}$ is zero

The space $R^n$ has dimension $n$, as each basis of $R^n$ consists of $n$ vectors

> For example, a basis for $R^3$ is $\{e_1, e_2, e_3\}$
