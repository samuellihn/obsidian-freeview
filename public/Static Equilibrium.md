An object is in equilibrium if it:
- Remains at rest
- If it moves in a straight line at constant speed

If an object is in equilibrium, its forces are **balanced**

**Contact forces** are forces from two interacting objects in contact with each other
Field forces are interactions between two objects that are not touching
