# New Direction for American Economy
19.2.1

Based economic policy on supply-side economics (**Reaganomics**) under the belief that if taxes are reduced, wealthy will invest more and create jobs, giving people money to spend so the economy grew, so the gov't would collect more taxes

To cut taxes, Reagan had to get rid of federal programs

**Economic Recovery Act of 1981**: reduced taxes by 23% over 3 years, richest Americans received largest tax cuts in hopes that they would invest extra money in new businesses. Also cut $40b from federal budget, mostly through ending social programs

Called for deregulation, airline, telecommunications, baking industries were deregulated by mid 1980s. Cut funding for agencies that oversaw many industries

Economy experienced recession from 1980 to 82, hit blue-collar owrkers hard, but then began to turn around in 1983. Caused by programs that tried to reduce inflation in 70s

GNP increased, but poor people also increased. Lots of immigrants from Latin America and Asia, most poor and working in low wage jobs. Rich grew richer. Economic disparity created great tensions between rich and poor, including in school funding

Reagan also increased federal deficit almost 3x from 81 to 86, mostly because of increased defense spending. National debt rose to $2.5t, almost set new records in 90s

**Savings and Loan Crisis**: many savings and loans banks failed, some because of fraudulent behavior but also many risky loans. Deregulation encouraged banks to invest in risky ventures, fed gov't spent $200b to bail out depositors to prevent panic

More old people in 1980s, social security began to bleed money, Social Security Reform Act raised min. retirement age and increased payroll tax in attempt to make S. S. at least break even

American exports were declining, Japan started to dominate American market and generate large trade deficit, Reagan placed tariff on Japanese electronics because Japan didn't ease restrictions on American imports. After tariff, Japan eased restrictions, but trade deficit remained

Many Air Traffic Controllers went on strike in 1981, Reagan fired all of them for violating law forbidding them to strike. Many admired Reagan's strong action, some thought he waged war against labor movement. 

> Nation became more conservative and labor movement shrunk, anti-union feelings grew, especially after PATCO (ATC) strike

Reagan thought volunteerism/private initiative would help citizens, some did. Clearinghouse on Corporate Social Responsibility improved American quality of life, example of private sector volunteerism worked.

# Conservatives Continue
19.2.2

Economic recovery improved national mood, Reagan was now popular. Reagan's upbeat spirit helped, even jovial in midst of an assassination attempt. Won reelection in 1984, but the House was still controlled by Democrats

Reagan appointed conservative justices to Supreme Court, including Sandra Day O'Connor, first female justice, moderate conservative who upheld Roe v. Wade

Congress passed **Equal Access Act**, requiring public secondary schools to allow any group equal access to school facilities, Supported by conservative Christians. Constitutionality upheld.

Reagan used popularity to campaign for George H. W. Bush, his VP for eight years. Initially lacked support from Republican conservatives, but still won the election. Democrats won majority seats in both House and Senate.

Wanted a "kinder, gentler nation", encouraged Americans to volunteer to curb federal spending and reduce gov't role.

Passed Americans with Disabilities Act, another step in protecting rights of all Americans

# Culture in 1980s
19.2.3

Many cultural and economic divides in 1980s society, in race, ethnicity, gender. Many poor which led to violence.

Americans became more materialistic and consumerism intensified, especially among young urban professionals ("yuppies"), high income people born in the baby boom (post WII). 

> Encompassed many people because of baby boom, high spending habits very noticed and criticized by media

People also wanted to be fit, lots of spending on looking good and being physically fit. Almost half of Americans exercised daily. Some criticized that instead of trying to improve society, many were trying to improve themselves

NASA made the space shuttle, *Challenger* exploded after takeoff which halted space program. However, space technology continued to creep into consumer products and improved American QOL

Olympics became valuable diplomatic tool, especially 1984 LA games, which was boycotted by Soviet Union and other communist countries.

Drug use also increased in 1980s, especially cocaine. Reagan enlisted military to stop cocaine smuggling in Florida, smugglers moved to Mexico. Very harsh penalties (up to 10y in prison for having drugs for sale)

Public schools were also in decline, conservatives wanted vouchers for private schools whereas liberals wanted to better fund public schools

AIDS came to attention in 1981, first spread among homosexual men and drug users, later spread to other groups. Killed 250k+ Americans by 1994. Reagan criticized for lack of response for AIDS crisis, he did increase funding but funding was not substantial until Bush. 

Reagan's assassination attempt increase anti-gun sentiment, opposed by National Rifle Association, despite strong opposition plastic handguns and armor-piercing bullets were eventually banned by Congress
