Modern secular societies do have legal constraints on communication

Copyright, patent, trademark, commercial secrets - prohibit expression of free speech and ideas

There are legal conditions that defined what may be communicated freely and the flow of speech has a shape that constitutes freedom

Laws that prohibit expression in public

> Copyright: workings of market economy and property
> Child pornography: omrals

Both define how property and protection define the person

Freedom is regarded as an inalienable form of property, except when suicide is concerned (the "dignity of human life")

> In a liberal democratic, the individual choice of voters must be hidden to be free

Freedom to consume is a source of corporate profit, but that may limit a citizen

Social constraint lies at the heart of individual choice - there is no truly "free" choice

Blasphemy arises from theological language in which social constraints are articulated, NOT from the nature of violation of these constraints

Seduction (coercion) is not considered a crime in modern liberal society

**The individual, as a consumer and voter, is therefore coerced by appeals to greed, vanity, envy, revenge, etc., and this is essential to the functioning of certain economic policy**

Freedom of speech in a liberal society is similar to blasphemy - there are societal constraints, even in "free" society, caused by market and political conditions, that limit what we can do or say

But blasphemy is seen in form rather than content, so lower-class/working-class vulgar speech can sometimes be seen as more blasphemous (class divide)

Publishing vs. speaking a thing is different- publishing is a threat to **social** order, although it may appeal to **moral** order (forcible subjection)

Seduction, in Islamic society, is problematic, even in a market society, it is not

Liberal universities - "freedom of speech" is asserted as a vaue

Secular universities emphasize research, professionalization, and specialization, fragmenting the traditional map of knowledge (that was grounded in theological thinking)

This was overcome by acquainting students with beauty (poetry, etc.)

Art, in liberal society, is a secular version of the Almighty = demands reverence and awe, and exists for its own sake, creating its own reality

Why is it that aggression in the name of God (killing in God's name, etc.) shock secular sensibilities but killing in the name of a nation does not (islamophobia)
