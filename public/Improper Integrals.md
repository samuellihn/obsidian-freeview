Two types of improper integrals:
- Definite integral with an infinite interval of integration
- Unbounded integrand inside an interval of integration (not well-behaved)

To solve, replace infinity with a variable and use a limit to solve

If a limit has a definite value, the integral **converges** to the value
If a limit does not exist or is infinite, the integral **diverges** 

Usually, a convergent improper integral will have infinity approach zero ($e^{-\infty}$, etc)

If we're approaching a concrete value (not infinity) in our interval, we must approach it from the correct side to stay within the integral of intevation

Example: $\int_0^1{ln{x}dx}$ turns into $lim_{a\to0^+}{\int_a^1{ln x dx}}$$

If we have two points that classify the integral as improper, then we can split the interval to create a separate interval for each side
