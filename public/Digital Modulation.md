# Binary Amplitude Shift Keying

Two different defined amplitudes represent the two states, 0 and 1
Transmitted in "frames" with a clock (one or two waves, etc)

# Binary Frequency Shift Keying

Two frequencies representing two standard states, 0 and 1
Example: 1200hz for 0, 2400hz for 1

# BInary Phase Shift Keying

In-phase wave period represents a 0, 90 degree shifted wave period represents a 1
