Angular displacement: change in angle ($\theta$)

Works same way as linear displacement:

Velocity $\omega$ is the derivative of displacement:

$$
\omega = \frac{\Delta{\theta}}{\Delta{t}}
$$

Acceleration $\alpha$ is the derivative of velocity

$$
\alpha = \frac{\Delta{\omega}}{\Delta{t}}
$$

The arc length covered by a given angular displacent depends on radius

To convert from angular quantities to linear quantities, 

$$
d = r\theta \ or \ v = r\omega \ or \ a = r \alpha
$$

> Angular component **must be in radians**

**Clockwise angles are negative, counterclockwise angles are positive**
> Their calculated linear counterparts will be the same sign

Three types of accelerations in rotational motion:

- Angular acceleration $\alpha$
- tangential acceleration $a_t$ (linear)
- centripital acceleration $a_c$ (also linear)

From there, we calculate total linear acceleration with the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
a_{total} = \sqrt{a_t + a_c}
$$

$$
a_c = \frac{\omega^2}{r}
$$

Angular velocity and frequency can be related with 

$$
\omega = 2\pi f
$$
