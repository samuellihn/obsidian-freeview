A **dielectric** is a non-conducting material placed between the plates of a capacitor that changes its capacitance

Three benefits
1. Help physically keep the two plates apart
2. Increases the maximum [[Electrical Potential]] difference (voltage) held between plates before capacitor starts to conduct (break down)
3. Increase the [[Capacitance]] of a capacitor

The factor a certain dielectric increases the [[Capacitance]] of a capacitor is called the **dielectric constant** (the ratio of capacitance with a capacitor with the dielectric vs. a capacitor with a vacuum)

 $$
 \kappa = \frac{C}{C_o}
 $$

Capacitance with dielectric over capacitance without dielectric

> A material (mylar) with a dielectric constant of 3.1 will have 3.1 times the capacitance of a capacitor with no (vacuum) dielectric
> Represented by $\kappa$

The electrons in dielectric materials are pulled towards the positive plate (electron deficit) side of the capacitor

This polarizes the atom and allows it to form a dipole with the positive part facing the negative (electron excess) part of the capacitor

This positive pole at the electron excess part of the capacitor attracts more electrons in (weakens the repulsion of the already-gathered electrons)

Therefore, more electrons can fit â†’ more capacitance

> Same thing happens on the other side - negative pole of dieletric helps push away more electrons from the positive plate

We can modify our capacitance equation for [[Parallel Plate Capacitors]] accounting for our dielectric:

$$
C = \frac{\kappa \epsilon_0 A}{d} \rightarrow C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}
$$

> $\epsilon$ is simply the permittivity of the dielectric (not permittivity of free space) (\epsilon = \kappa \epsilon_0)
