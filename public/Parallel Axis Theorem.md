[[Moment of Inertia]] through an axis parallel to the central axis will be the sum of the moment of inertia through the central axis  and $MD^2$

$$I = I_{cm} + MD^2$$
> $I_{cm}$ is the axis of rotation through the center of mas
> $D$ is the distance between the old axis of rotation and the new axis of rotation
