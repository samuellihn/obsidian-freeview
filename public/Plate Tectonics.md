Seven major tectonic plates that fit together like puzzle pieces

Tectonic plates move anywhere from 2 to 15 centimeters per year

> At least twice in Earth's history have the continents joined together to form a large landmass (example: Pangea)

Plate tectonics are the study of movement of the lithosphere's plates over the asthenosphere of the mantle

Each tectonic plate moves independently of other plates, as determined by the magma flow underneath the plate.

This movement creates the topography of Earth
- Causes earthquakes, volcanoes, geysers, tsunamis
- Changes location and size of continents, alters atmosphere and ocean circulate, **altering the climate**
