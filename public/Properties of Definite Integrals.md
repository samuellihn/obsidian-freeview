**Constant rule:**

$$
\int_a^b k*f(x)\ dx =  k*\int_a^b f(x)\ dx
$$

**Sum (and difference) rule: **

$$
\int_a^b [f(x) + g(x)] \ dx =  \int_a^b f(x)\ dx + \int_a^b g(x)\ dx
$$

**Reversal of limits: **

$$
\int_b^a{f(t)dt} = -\int_a^b{f(t)dt}
$$

>  Useful in the case $a < b$:

**Adjacent intervals:**

$$
\int_a^b f(x) \ dx =  \int_a^c f(x)\ dx + \int_c^b f(x)\ dx \ when \ a < c < b
$$ 

> Make sure condition is met!

**Same limit of integration**

$$
\int_a^a f(x) \ dx =  0
$$

**integral of a constant:**

$$
\int_a^b k \ dx =  k *(b-a)
$$

> If a rectangle has no width, it cannot have area either

Not a property, but note the **chain rule** in the [[Fundemental Theorem of Calculus]]

If the we are taking the definite integral of is undefined at **any point** in that interval the interval is also nonexistence
> Must be "well-behaved" (cannot integrate asymptote/hole, etc)
