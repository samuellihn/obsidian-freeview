A **tone** is a analog signal comprising of only one frequency

Analog signals with multiple frequencies are called **complex waves**

$$\lambda = \frac{c}{f}$$


General equation of analog signals:

$$v(t) = V sin(2\pi ft+\theta) \ or \ v(t) = V sin(\omega t+\theta)$$

$V$ is source voltage
$2\pi$ is a scaling factor to scale the period to one second
$f$ is the frequency of the wave
$\theta$ is the phase shift
$v$ is the resultant voltage
