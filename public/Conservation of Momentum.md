In a system, 

$$
p_{initial} + I = p_{final}
$$

Internal forces only transfer momentum to other objects in the system. Only external forces can change the momentum (Assuming no nonconservative forces like friction, etc)

When objects are forced against each other, they can collide or push together and break apart (explode)

When linear momentum is conserved, the velocity of the center of mass is conserved

**Three types of collisions:**

**Inelastic:** some kinetic energy turned into potential energy, heat, sound

Perfect ineastic collisions will make objects stick together (they will move together with same velocity)

$$
m_av_a+m_bv_b = (m_a+m_b)v' 
$$

**Elastic:** bounce off while **conserving [[Linear Kinetic Energy]]**

Velocities may change if the two colliding masses, but:

$$
m_av_a+m_bv_b = m_av_a'+m_bv_b' 
$$

Combined with the conservation of kinetic energy, we get:

$$
v_a - v_b=-(v'_a - v'_b)
$$

Initial difference in velocities will be same as the final distance, except in the opposite direction, **irrespective of mass**

If two objects are the same mass, they will **exchange** their velocity when they collide
> Some collisions lose so little energy we treat them like elastic colilsions

**Explosion:** one or both objects break apart because potential energy in one of the objects turns into kinetic energy

Reverse of a perfectly inelastic collision
Two objects moving together into two objects moving away from each other

$$
 (m_a+m_b)v =  m_av'_a+m_bv'_b 
$$

> Most of the time, we'll need to zero out the momentum vector by equating both sides

> Cart with compressed spring (EPE turns into kinetic energy as carts start moving)
> Potential chemical energy turned into light and sound in a firecracker

**No matter the type of collision, momentum and energy are conserved**
