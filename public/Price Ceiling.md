**Price ceiling** - legally established maximum price exposed on a good or service

A **nonbinding** price ceiling is one that is set at or above the equilibrium price, and thus has no effect

A **binding** price ceiling is one that "bites" - it is set below the equilibrium price and therefore affects the market

Effects of a price ceiling:

- $Q_D > Q_S$, creating a shortage
- Decreases quality of the good
- Increases the opportunity cost for consumers to find that good
- Black market for that good will arise
- Shortage will worsen over time, as there is no incentive to increase (or even maintain) production capacity
- Demand becomes more elastic as people begin to find alternatives

The first price ceiling was established in the U. S. after WW2

Widespread price ceiling example - **Rent control**

Effects
- $Q_D > Q_S$
- Quality of housing decreases
- Harder to find an apartment (opportunity cost increases)
- Black market for housing develops (illegal housing)
- Decrease in long-term investment in new/renovated houses/developments
- Landlords may charge fees to tenants to increase revenue
