If we are trying to find a limit and end up wtih an indeterminate form ($\frac{0}{0}$), $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ or $\frac{-\infty}{-\infty}$, we can take the derivative of both the numerator and denominator and take the limit of those instead

If we still get an indeterminate form or an infinity, we can repeat this again

This can also be used graphically, when given a graph of a function involved in a limit

Never write that a limit equals $\frac{0}{0}$
Instead, write that the numerator equals 0, and the denominator equals zero

Don't forget to check for the indeterminate form
