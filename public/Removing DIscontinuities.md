A hole is a **removable discontinuity** - we can remove it by "plugging up" the hole

  Infinite and jump discontinuities cannot be removed - The limit is not defined in these discontinuities

How to "plug up" holes?

Redefine a point to equal the limit at that x value - define the function at the point where the hole is, with the value of the limit at that point

Either define the point as a constant in a piecewise function or an expression that produces a value that wuld make the function continuous


**If a limit of a function exists at a discontinuity in its graph, then it is possible to remove its discontinuity**

Can also make piecewise functions continuous by choosing parameters that make their endpoints "meet"

Be careful when factoring and removing discontinuities!

> Can only remove if in indeterminate form - make sure it's **not an asymptote**
