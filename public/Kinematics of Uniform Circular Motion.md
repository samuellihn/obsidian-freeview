Motion in a circle at constant radius and constant **speed**

Velocity is always tangent to the circle at the point of the object
Acceleration always points towards the center of the circle, called **centripital acceleration**
> Velocity and acceleration are always perpendicular

$$
a=\frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Calculate the arc of a circle to get travelled **distance**
Calculate the **chord** between two points to get **displacement**

> The velocity is changing direction, which is why acceleration is still present

$$
v=\frac{2\pi r}T
$$
