Only known planet to support carbon-based life

**Liquid water** as a result of distance from sun

Maintains steady temperature (acts as heat sink), transports material through cells, forms ice which floats on water

Hospitable atmosphere - $O_2$ for breathing, $CO_2$ for photosynthesis and keeps heat inside

[[Earth's Rotation and Revolution]] allows for varying amounts of **solar intensity**, alloiwing for seasons

Solar energy is Earth's main source of energy
