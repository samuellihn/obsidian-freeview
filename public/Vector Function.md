A vector function is a function whose domain is a subset of the set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors

Vector functions can be written in many ways:

Name | Example
---|---
	Component Form | $\hat{r} = r(t) = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle$
Unit Vector Form | $\hat{r} = r(t) = x(t)\hat{i} + y(t) \hat{j}$
[[Parametric Equation]] Form | $s(t) = (x(t), y(t))$

Vector functions and [[Parametric Equation]]s are synonymous - accept a $t$, get an $x$ and $y$ that descrobes a vector

Like a [[Vector Field]], but with only one independent variable

To find the domain of a vector function, find the intersection $\cap$ of the two sets of numbers of the two components (where the two domans **overlap**)

The limit of a vector function $r(t) = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle$ is simply:

$$\lim_{t\to a}{r(t)} = \langle \lim_{t\to a}{x(t)}, \lim_{t\to a}{y(t)} \rangle$$
> Both limits of the components must exist

Don't forget to write the final answer as a vector (either in component form or unit vector form)

LIkewise, a vector function is continuous at $a$ if

- $r(a)$ exists
- $\lim_{t\to a}{r(t)}$ exists
- $\lim_{t\to a}{r(t)} = r(a)$ 

> Same criteria as for [[Continuity at a Point]] for rectangular functions
> If any of the components are not continuous, the vector function will not be either
