Fertilizer: Contains Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium

NItrogen and phosphorous are **limiting factors** for plant growth (see [[Nitrogen Cycle]], [[Phosphorous Cycle]])

Increased nitrogen and phosphorous (especially in water) leads to increased population of algae/aquatic plants

> Caused by runoff (see [[Water Cycle]]) from fertilizer into water bodies

Known as **algae bloom** - when this causes negative effects, known as **eutrophication** - when a body of water is so enriched/nutritious it negatively affects health of ecosystem

Eutrophication sequences:

> Increased plant life = more food = more organisms (fish), then not enough dissolved oxygen to support more life
> Algae blooms block sunlight to bottom of water body, plants on bottom die off, decomposition of dead plants reduces DO levels and kills fish and other organisms

Can also be caused by wastewater, as it contains high amounts of N and P as well

Levels of eutrophication:
- **Oligotrophic** - very low nutrient amount, stable algae production, high DO levels
- **Eutrophic lake** - high levels of nutrients & bio. productivity
- **Highly eutrophic lake** - Excessive plant and algae growth, limited visibility, so little DO normal aquatic life dies off
- **Hypoxia** - depleted levels of DO - can no longer support living organisms
