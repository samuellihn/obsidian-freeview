# Solids, Liquids, and gases

Solids
-   Below a certain temperature, molecules are vibrating but locked in place
-   Molecules are not necessarily closer together than in a liquid

    -   Ex. - Water - Ice floats because molecules are farther apart than in the liquid state

Liquids
-   Molecules are moving too fast, are not locked in place anymore
-   Molecules are able to move freely and slide past each other
-   Some molecules on surface can evaporate (escape from the surface of the liquid)



Gas
-   Invisible - particles are too far apart to see
-   Molecules are significantly farther apart than liquid and solids
-   Particles almost have no attractive forces - moving too fast, too much energy
-   Collision against walls of container determines pressure
