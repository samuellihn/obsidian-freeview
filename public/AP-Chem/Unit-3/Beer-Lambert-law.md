        -   How intensely a sample absorbs light of a specific wavelength

    -   B is the path length

    -   C is the concentration of the solution (molarity)
	
-   Path length and concentration are proportional to the number of absorbing species
-   The quantity of light being absorbed by a substance is directly proportional to the concentration
-   Usually, path length (b) and wavelength are held constant

    -   Absorbance usually proportional to concentration of absorbing species
