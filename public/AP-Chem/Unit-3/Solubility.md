# Solubility

Substances with similar intermolecular attractions will (tend to) be soluble (miscible) with one another



Ionic compounds - soluble in water => water dipoles interact and separate cations and anions



Molecular compounds with only LDF => dissolve in nonpolar solvents - larger electron cloud = more polarizable => will dissolve more



**"Like Dissolves Like"**
-   Nonpolar solutes dissolve in nonpolar solvents
-   Polar solutes dissolve in polar solvents

IMF and degree of IMF determines solubility in particular solvent

Polar + polar => solution

Nonpolar + nonpolar => solution

Polar + nonpolar => suspension (no even mixing)



TL;DR:
-   Substances with similar intermolecular interactions tend to be miscible/soluble in one another
-   Substances with dissimilar intermolecular interactions tend to be immiscible/insoluble in one another
