# Ideal Gas Law

Volume - amount of space occupied by the gas

Temperature - measurement of the average kinetic energy of gas molecules

Amount - measured in moles

Pressure - force on walls of container by molecular collisions



Boyle's Law - PV = k

Pressure and volume are inversely proportional

P = 1/V

Avogadro's Law - P = kn or V = kn

Number of moles (n) and pressure are directly proportional

Number of moles (n) and volume are directly proportional

More particles = more volume or pressure, pick one



Charles' Law - V = bT

Temperature (T) must be in Kelvin (K = C + 273)

Volume directly proportional to temperature

Ideal Gas Law: PV = nRT where:
-   P = pressure
-   V = volume
-   n = number of moles
-   R = proportionality constant (0.08206 L x atm / mol x K
-   T = temperature in Kelvin

Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures:



P(total) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)

P(A), (B),... are partial pressures: the pressure exerted by only gases A, B,,,,

IDEAL GASES behave the same no matter what they are



Mole Fraction: the ratio of moles of one gas to the total # of moles

X(i) = n(i) / n(total)



Because volume, temperature are constant in a mixture of gases:

X(i) = n(i) / n(total) = P(i) / P(total)
P(i) = X(i) x P(total)
