# Moles and Molar Mass
-   Moles are used to relate units of mass to the number of particles
-   Mole: 6.022 * 10^23^ particles

    -   Particles can have different weights

    -   Therefore, moles of particles of different substances have different weights
-   To find the molar mass of a specific substance, multiply the subscript of each type of atom by the atomic mass (in periodic table) of each type of atom
-   A mole is set up so that the atomic mass of 1 particle in amu is the same as the mass of 1 mole in grams: the **molar mass (grams/mole)**

    -   1 mole of a substance = molar mass of a substance in grams
