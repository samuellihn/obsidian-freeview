# Buffer Capacity
-   A buffer should be able to control pH after adding a **reasonable amount** of acid and base

    -   Increasing the concentration of the buffer components keeps the pH of the buffer the same

        -   Increases the amount of acid or base the buffer can neutralize

            -   As long as the relative concentrations remain constant

    -   Determining the pH of a buffer is only based on **relative** moles of acid and conjugate base

    -   Diluting a buffer solution will not change its pH (moles still the same)
-   A buffer solution should hold the pH (to a certain extent) at the desired value

    -   Choose an acid with K~a~ close to the intended value of [H^+^]

    -   Exact value of [H^+^] can be achieved by adjusting the ratio of acid and conjugate base

    -   Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used to determine the ideal ratio of conjugate base to acid concentration
-   **Less moles of buffer => lower capacity**
-   **More moles of buffer => higher capacity**
