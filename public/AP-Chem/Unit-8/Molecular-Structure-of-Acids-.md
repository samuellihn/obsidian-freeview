# Molecular Structure of Acids and Bases

    -   Stronger acids have weak H-X bonds

        -   Have more stable conjugates (less likely to disassociate)

        -   HCl - bond between H and Cl is weak

    -   Weaker acids have strong H-X bonds

        -   Have less stable conjugates

        -   HF - bond between H and F is strong

    -   Why?

        -   Weaker bonds => more disassociation

            -   H^+^ is pulled away more easily

-   **Oxoacids/oxyacids:** an atom bonded with one or more oxygen atoms, sometimes with hydrogen atoms attached
-   **Inductive Effect**: the attraction of electrons in adjacent bonds by more electronegative atoms

    -   Strong acids can experience an inductive effect

        -   Due to highly electronegative oxygen atoms

-   Hydrogen is pulled away from OH

    -   In this case, creates resonance structures as H^+^ is being pulled between nitrogen atoms

    -   **More electronegative atoms => electrons will be pulled away from hydrogen, making it more likely to disassociate**

    -   **Even charge => more stable (weaker)**

    -   Electronegative elements stabilize a conjugate base relative to its conjugate acid

        -   Able to handle negative charge better

```
-   Weak acids, like carboxylic (COOH) acids, do not experience a strong induced dipole force

    -   **Less polarity => hydrogen ion more attracted to oxygen => less ionizable (harder to take away H^+^)**

    -   **Conjugate bases are less stable, which results in them being stronger**

    -   Example: Acetate is a stronger conjugate base, which is less stable than acetic acid

-   **Bases**

    -   Stronger bases tend to attract protons

        -   Two factors that influence a strength of a base:

            -   How easily a lone pair picks up a hydrogen ion

            -   The stability of the ions being formed

        -   The conjugate bases of:

            -   Carboxylic acids

            -   Anions of other weak acids

            -   Hydrated metal cations

        -   All act as bases

            -   Organic amines (ammonia compounds) also act as bases

        -   Remember: larger K~b~ indicates a better proton acceptor

    -   More negative charge => attracts protons
