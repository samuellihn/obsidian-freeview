# Elementary Reactions
-   The rate law for an elementary reaction can be inferred from the stoichiometry of the participating molecules

    -   Elementary reactions usually involve the collision of two molecules

        -   Simultaneous collision of 3+ particles are extremely rare

-   **Reaction Mechanism**: the process by which a reaction occurs

    -   The elementary reactions in a multistep mechanism must always add to give the overall reaction for the overall process

    -   **Intermediates:** Substances that are formed in one elementary reaction then consumed in the next
