# Reaction Mechanisms

    -   The sum of the elementary steps must lead to the final, overall reaction **with the correct stoichiometry**

    -   The mechanism must agree with an experimentally determined rate law expression
-   To add elementary steps:

    -   Cancel elements that show up as a product/reactant on one side and as a reactant/product on the other

    -   Mark everything that remains

    -   Combine all into one chemical equation, keeping products as products and reactants as reactants


-   A **reaction mechanism** addresses:

    -   What are the yields and quantities involved in stoichiometry or equilibrium?

    -   What are the changes in entropy and enthalpy?

    -   How do the molecules interact at an atomic/molecular level?

    -   How do changing concentrations/other conditions affect the reaction rate?
-   By **suggesting a series of elementary steps** by which collisions actually occur
-   Reaction mechanisms are arrived at using a semi-empirical method

    -   Theoretical, but rely on experimental (empirical) data for verification/direction
-   **Overall balanced equation: starting point and destination**
-   **Mechanism: step-by-step directions**
-   How to define an elementary step?

    -   Clearly a part of a multi-step mechanism

    -   Question clearly indicates the reaction is an elementary step

        -   (usually whether or not it is an elementary step is a given)
-   **Catalyst:** a substance that increases the rate of reaction

    -   By either:

        -   Stabilizing the transition state

        -   Forming a new transition state

    -   Present at the beginning and end of the experiment

        -   **Consumed, then reformed**

    -   Don't usually show up in overall balanced equation

        -   Sometimes shown above the arrow in the equation

    -   Shows up first as a reactant, then last as a product
-   **Intermediate substance:** A temporary substance that is **formed then consumed** the mechanism

    -   Shows up in any one of the steps first as a product, then as a reactant

    -   Will not show up in the final rate law expression

    -   Cancels out when forming the final balanced equation
