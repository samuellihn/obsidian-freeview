# Reactions - intro

Physical changes
-   Composition of substance does not change
-   Physical properties (shape, solubility) may change
-   Ex.

    -   Separation of mixtures (composition of components do not change)

    -   Phase changes (ice, water, water vapor are all H2O)

Chemical changes
-   Occur when a substance undergoes a reaction and a new substance is formed
-   Chemical properties change - reactivity with acids, flammability
-   New composition is formed
-   Evidences of chemical change:

    -   Heat or light produced

    -   Formation of precipitate (formation of a new substance)
