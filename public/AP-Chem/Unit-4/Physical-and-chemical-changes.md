# Physical and chemical changes
-   Macroscopic changes and particle interactions have a relationship

    -   Physical processes - change in **INTERMOLECULAR** interactions

        -   Ex. Water becomes ice, butter melts, etc.

        -   Bonds are (usually) not broken or formed during physical changes

        -   Chemical compositions remain unchanged

    -   Processes that involve forming/breaking **INTRAMOLECULAR** bonds are referred to as chemical reactions

        -   Chemical composition of new substance has changed

    -   Some physical processes can break chemical bonds

        -   Ex: dissolution

            -   Salt's ionic bond is broken as it is pulled apart in water and the salt is dissolved

            -   Ion-dipole interactions then form between water (polar) and ions

            -   May be referred to as **either** a physical OR chemical process

    -   Example: the breaking of hydrogen bonds is a physical process, as these bonds are INTERmolecular

    -   Formation of new compounds occur in chemical processes
