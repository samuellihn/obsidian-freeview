# Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control
-   Some reactions are thermodynamically favorable but do not **appear** to make products at a measurable rate

    -   These processes are under "kinetic control"

        -   Generally have a large activation energy that accounts for slow rate of reaction
-   A process occurring slowly/immeasurably **does not mean the process is at equilibrium**

    -   If a process is thermodynamically favorable and still does not occur at a measurable rate, the process is under **kinetic control**

        -   **Kinetic Control:** a **slowing of the rate of reaction** due to **kinetic properties such as activation energy**, not thermodynamic properties

        -   A catalyst can be used to decrease activation energy and increase reaction rate

        -   **Catalysts** have NO EFFECT on thermodynamic favorability--they merely reduce activation energy
