An alternating series contains terms that are both positive and negative

Signs swap back and forth between positive and negative

Ways to create an alternating series:
- $(-1)^n$ in front of the series, so it is positive whenever n is even
- $(-1)^{n+1}$ or $(-1)^{n-1}$, which swaps the signs so the term is positive whenever n is odd
- $\cos{n \pi}$, uses an periodic sinusoidal to swap the signs between positivee (even) and negative (odd)

Alternating series can exhibit **three** different types of behavior:
1. Divergence
2. **Absolute** convergence (if the absolute values of each term converge)

> A series absolutely converges if it still converges after removing the alternating component

4. **Conditional** convergence (if the absolute values of each term cause the series to diverge)
