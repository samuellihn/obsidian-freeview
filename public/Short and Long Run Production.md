**Short run** - at least one factor of production is fixed

**Long run** - all factors of production are flexible

In the long run, a firm gets to choose what production factors it wants (factory size, etc.)

The long-run curve shows us how scale affects production cost

**Economies of scale** - when costs drop as output rises

> Specialization

**Diseconomies of scale** - when costs rise as output rises

> Coordination problems/management, while specialization problems have already been solved

**Constants return to scale** - when costs do not change with quantity
