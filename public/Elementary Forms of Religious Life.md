Religion -a whole of complex parts, system of myths, dogmas ,rites, ceremonies that operate as an indivisible entity

Religious phenomena - beliefs and rites

> Beliefs: States states of opinion, consists of representations that express the nature of sacred things
> Rites: Rules of conduct that prescribe how man must conduct himself with sacred things

Distinguished "only by the special nature of their object" that is thereby expressed in the belief

**Religious beliefs classify real and ideal things into** *profane* and *sacred*

> *Sacred:* things that are radically set apart from the profane that are associated with religious ideals - NOT defined by the traditional hierarchy of things (Jesus washing feet) or its extraordinariness, but by its drastic separation 
> > Protected and isolated by prohibitions
> 
> *Profane:* NOT in the traditional sense of "bad", but everyday and mundane, but simply not set apart
> > Things for which sacred prohibitions are applied
> 
> There is nothing to define the sacred and profane other than their absolute, drastic heterogeneity (set apart from each other)

Initiation - introduces young man into religious life, comes out of profane world, enters into world of sacred things

Antagonism between sacred and profane worlds - radically separated, something sacred has fully left the profane world

> Monasticism - complete separation from the profane to live a completely and exclusively religious life
> Asceticism - uproots one's attachment to the profane world (think religious suicide)

There is deep repugnance about contact or mingling between sacred and profane things (taboo)

> Open question - What causes man to see the world as two incomparable worlds, and inspires such drastic religious feelings?

**What distinguishes magic from religion?**

Magic, too, has beliefs and rites, but magic and religion are pitted against each other and magic is antireligious, and the mystical forces utilized by both are the same

Magic is **professional** - a pleasure of profaning holy things

Religious beliefs are shared by a group that professes them and practices the corresponding rites

**Church** - "A society whose members are united because they imagine the sacred world and its relations with the profane world in the same way"

Magic does not have a church, magicians have clientele that do not interact with each other - "analogous of a sick man with his doctor"

Religion is inseparable from the idea of a Church

**But then, how do we explain individual religions that belong to only one person?** - the individual members still make up a whole church

Durkheim's definition: *A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden - beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them*
