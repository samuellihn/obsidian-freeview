A bridge circuit looks like this:

Again, use [[Kirchoff's Loop Rule]] and [[Kirchoff's Junction Rule]] to solve these circuits, as (assuming switch is open) the currents going though A/C and B/D will add to the total current

> If the total resistances in each path is equal, then the two currents are equal

Also consider [[Resistors in Parallel]] to solve for total resistance, and initial current going into the bridge

Sometimes, the bridge may be a combination of capacitors and resistors, remember the [[Capacitors In Series]] and [[Capacitors in Parallel]] rules

> Remember that **current initially cannot flow through capacitors!**
