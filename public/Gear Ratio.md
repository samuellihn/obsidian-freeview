The linear velocity of points on the pitch circle (pitch radius) is the same

Therefore, 

$$
\omega_1 R_{P_1} = \omega_2 R_{P_2}
\rightarrow
\frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2} = \frac{R_{P_2}}{R_{P_1}}
$$

Gears therefore trade [[Rotational Kinematics|angular velocity]] for [[Torque]]

The gear ration is defined as the ratio of the driver gear and driven gear

If the gear ratio is $3:4$, that means the input gear needs to turn 3 times for the output gear to turn 4 times

$$
\text{Gear ratio}= \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2} = \frac{R_{P_2}}{R_{P_1}} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{N_2}{N_1}
$$

Where 1 is the driving gear, and 2 is the driven gear
