**Toughness** is resistance to **fracture**, or propogation of cracks in a material

> Even seemingly undamaged material has cracks

The **stress intensity factor** is a measure of the internal stresses of a crack at a particular location of a specific part

$$
K_I = K_I(\sigma, Crack \ Size, Crack \ Location)
$$
Whereas fracture toughness (toughness), is a function of **material** (a material property)

$$
K_{Ic} = K_{Ic}(material)
$$

A **brittle** material therefore has low fracture toughness (once a crack starts to grow, it grows fast with little yielding)

> This is why materials shatter

A **ductile** material has a high fracture toughness - the material around the crack will yield, inhibiting crack growth
