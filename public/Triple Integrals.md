A triple integral is a generalization of the single and double integrals. It is a method of evaluating the volume of a three-dimensional solid region. The triple integral is written as follows:

$$
\int_a^b\int_c^d\int_e^f f(x,y,z) dx dy dz
$$

where $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ are real numbers, and $f(x,y,z)$ is a continuous function.

To evaluate a triple integral, we first need to find the bounds of integration for each variable. Then, we can evaluate the integral one variable at a time.

For example, if we want to find the volume of a solid region bounded by the planes $x=0$, $x=1$, $y=0$, $y=1$, $z=0$, and $z=1$, we would use the triple integral:

$$
\int_0^1\int_0^1\int_0^1 f(x,y,z) dx dy dz
$$

where $f(x,y,z)=1$.

To evaluate this integral, we would first find the bounds of integration for $x$. Since $x$ goes from $0$ to $1$, the bounds of integration for $x$ are $0$ and $1$. Then, we would find the bounds of integration for $y$. Since $y$ goes from $0$ to $1$, the bounds of integration for $y$ are $0$ and $1$. Finally, we would find the bounds of integration for $z$. Since $z$ goes from $0$ to $1$, the bounds of integration for $z$ are $0$ and $1$.

Now that we have found the bounds of integration for each variable, we can evaluate the integral one variable at a time.

To evaluate the integral with respect to $x$, we would use the following formula:

$$
\int_a^b f(x,y,z) dx = \int_a^b f(x,y,z_0) dz + \int_a^b f(x,y,z_1) dz
$$

where $z_0$ and $z_1$ are the lower and upper bounds of integration for $z$, respectively.

To evaluate the integral with respect to $y$, we would use the following formula:

$$
\int_a^b f(x,y,z) dy = \int_a^b f(x,y_0,z) dx + \int_a^b f(x,y_1,z) dx
$$

where $y_0$ and $y_1$ are the lower and upper bounds of integration for $y$, respectively.

To evaluate the integral with respect to $z$, we would use the following formula:

$$
\int_a^b f(x,y,z) dz = f(x,y,z_0) + f(x,y,z_1)
$$

where $z_0$ and $z_1$ are the lower and upper bounds of integration for $z$, respectively.

Once we have evaluated the integral with respect to each variable, we can add the results together to get the final answer.

In this case, the final answer is $1$.
