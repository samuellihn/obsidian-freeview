Free body diagrams are used to daw the exact [[Static Equilibrium]] acting on on object

Can be used to determine:
- An unknown force
- Finding [[Weight]] to find the acceleration of the object 
- Identifying forces that cancel each other out

How to draw:

1. Put a dot in the center of the diagram
2. Draw arrows pointing out on the direction of all forces coming out of the object
3. Label the arrows
4. Use all forces, including gravity and [[Static Equilibrium#Normal Force|Normal Force]]

Once we use the free body diagram to find the [[Weight]], acceleration can be found using [[Newton's Laws of Motion#Second Law of Motion|Newton's Second Law]]
