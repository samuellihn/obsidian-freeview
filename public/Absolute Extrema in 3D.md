The [[Extreme Value Theorem]] also extends to three dimensions

If $f(x, y)$ is continuous in a closed, bounded region, then $f(x, y)$ has absolute minima and maxima in that region

Very similar to finding absolute extrema in 2D, following the same 3 steps

1. Find all [[Critical Points in 3D|critical points]] inside the region and evaluate them
2. Test the boundaries of the region
3. The largest and smallest values produced in the last two steps are the absolute extrema in that region
