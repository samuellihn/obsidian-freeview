The **optimal choice** of a combination of two goods is when the [[Indifference Curve]] is tangent to the [[Budget Line]]

Goal: we want to maximize utility (move the indifference curve as far out as possible) while staying within our budget constraint (under the budget line)

We will move the indifference curve as far out as possible until it only touches the budget line at one point

This is our optimal choice, when the slope of the budget curve equals the slope of the indifference curve
