**Dielectric Breakdown**: When the electric field of a capacitor is so strong that the electrons in the dielectric are forced away from their parent atoms and discharge the positively charged plate

> So much potential that the capacitor will "spark" and the electrons will get ripped away

In other words, how much voltage a dielectric can handle before it starts to conduct electricity (like arcing on electric wires)

Measured in $\frac{kV}{mm|}$ until dielectric breakdown

[[Electric Field]]s can also be measured in $\frac{V}{d}$ 
> If a charge is moved a distance $d$ in the field, it will gain or lose $v$ volts

Therefore, if a dielectric experiences an electric field stronger than that of its dielectric strength, it will break down
