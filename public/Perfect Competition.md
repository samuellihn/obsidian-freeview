A **perfectly competitive market**:

1. Has many buyers and sellers in the market
2. The goods offered by different sellers are the same
3. Firms can freely enter and exit the market

The actions of any seller in the buyer has little/no effect on the market price - every seller and buyer is a **price taker

Marginal [[Revenue]] for a firm in a competitive market equals the price of the good, and is constant (how much the firm can get by selling one unit of the good)
