The dot product is the sum of the component-wise multiplication of two vectors

$$\langle 5, 4 \rangle \cdot \langle 7, 3 \rangle = 3 \times 5 
 + 4 \times 7$$

Component-wise scaling of each component, wiht a different scale factor for each

Can also find the angle between two vectors with the dot product

$$a \cdot b = |a||b| \cos{\theta}$$
