Lines, planes, other objects in $R^n$ constructed with sets of vectors can be subspaces if they meet three properties:

A subspace $H$ in $R^n$ has three properties:

1. The zero vector is in $H$
2. For each $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ in $H$, their sum $\vec{u} + \vec{v}$ is in $H$
3. For each $\vec{u}$ in $H$ and $c$ is any scalar, the vector $c\vec{u}$ is in $H$

Properties 2 and 3 can be described as follows:

**A subspace is closed under addition and scalar multiplication**

> This means that in the subspace any arbitrary two vectors can be added, and any arbitrary vector and scalar can be multiplied, and there result will **always be** in the subspace

A span of two vectors $Span\{\vec{u}, \vec{v}\}$ (a plane) is a subspace:
- Zero vector is in the subspace $0\vec{u} + 0\vec{v} = \vec{0}$
- Addition is closed $\vec{u} + \vec{v}$ is spanned by $Span\{\vec{u}, \vec{v}\}$
- Multiplication is closed ($c\vec{u}$ or $c\vec{v})$

In $R^3$, subspaces can be:

- Point at origin
- Line that passes through origin (span of one vector)
- Plane that passes through origin (span of two vectors)
- Entire $R^3$
> A subset does not necessarily need to be smaller than what it lies in - a subset of $R^3$ can be $R^3$
