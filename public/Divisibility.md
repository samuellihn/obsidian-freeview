Division theorem - given two integers that are divided, the result will have a quotient and a remainder

$$n = dq + r, \  0 \leq r < d$$

> $n$: dividend
> $q$: quotient
> $r$: remainder


> The remainder **must be non-negative** - important when $n$ is negative!

Divides: $y|x$ is read as:

- $y$ goes evenly into $x$
- $y$ is a factor of $x$
- $x$ is a multiple of $y$
> Note that $y$ is the divisor and $x$ is the dividend
