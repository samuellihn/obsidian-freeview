An **indifference curve** represents **all the different combinations of two goods that bring the same [[Utility]]** 

Indifference curves are **always convex to the origin** (always concave up) - this is because of the **law of diminishing marginal utility**, or the consumer "taste for variety"

An indifference curve **further from the origin** is one that represents a greater utility

Indifference curves **can never intersect**!- there can never be a point where one combination of goods has two different utilities

The **marginal rate of substitution** is the slope of the indifference curve - how much of one good we give up for one unit of another, assuming constant utility
