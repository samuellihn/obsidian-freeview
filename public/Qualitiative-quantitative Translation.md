#ProblemSolving 

Find the equation anyways to analyze the problem (even if the problem says "without using equations")

Then, translate that into qualitative words by observing the relationships in the equation

State these relationships in the summary as the "why" ("direct", "proportional", "inversely proportional", etc.)
