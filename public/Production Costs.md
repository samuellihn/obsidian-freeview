Production costs: land, labor, and capital ("impossible trinity")

Total costs can be divided into **explicit** and **implicit** costs

Explicit costs - wages, cost of raw materials, bills, etc.

Implicit costs - opportunity costs - what else could I be doing with my time/money?

Profit $\pi$

$\pi = T_R - T_C$

> Profit equals total [[Revenue]] minus total cost

Accounting profit: $T_R - \text{Explicit cost}$

Economic profit: $T_R - \text{Explicit cost} - \text{Implicit cost}$
