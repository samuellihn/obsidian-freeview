Uniform fields are not radial: a particle will experience the same force regardless of where it is in the field

Similar to small-scale gravitational fields: uniform force/acceleration pointing to a specific drection

Objects launched inside the field will experience parabolic motion as long as there is an initial velocity perpendicular to the field
