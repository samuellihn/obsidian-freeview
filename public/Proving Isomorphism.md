How to prove that graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic:

Show identical adjacency matrices

or

Show a mapping (either using $\rightarrow$ or function notation between distinct vertices of $G$ and $H$

> If the graph has multiple edges, a mapping of edges is also needed

How to prove that graphs $G$ and $H$ are **not** isomorphics

Show that they differ in some fundamental using [[Graph Invariants]]
