In linear motion, $Impulse = F * \Delta{t}$
[[Conservation of Momentum]]

In angular motion, $Impulse = L = \tau * \Delta{t}$

Moment of inertia of an object inside angular motion depends on its radius
For a point mass,

$$
I = MR^2
$$,Which is constant for a specific shape

$$

\tau = I\alpha

$$
Therefore, the total moment of inertia is the sum of all components in the rotating object

The greater the moment of inertia, the lesser the angular acceleration

Shape | Equation for $I$ | Notes
----|---- | ---
Hoop or Cylindrical Shell |  $MR^2$ | Where the thickness of the material is negligible, and $R$ is the radius of the inner surface
Hollow Cylinder | $\frac{1}{2}M(R_{inner}^2 + R_{outer}^2)$ | Accounts for thickness of cylinder wall
Disk or Solid Cylinder  | $\frac{1}{2}MR^2$ | 
Rectangular plate | $\frac{1}{12}M(a^2 + b^2)$ | Where $a$ and $b$ are the width and height of the rectangle. Thickness is negligible.
Long thin rod | $\frac{1}{12}ML^2$ | Symmetrical about axis of rotation
Long thin rod | $\frac{1}{3}ML^2$ | Only on one side of axis of rotation
Solid sphere | $\frac{2}{5}MR^2$ | 
Spherical Shell | $\frac{2}{5}MR^2$ | Where $R$ is the radius of the inner surface and thickness is negligible
