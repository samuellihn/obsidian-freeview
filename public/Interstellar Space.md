Heliosphere: outer atmosphere of the sun, marks edge of sun's magnetic influence in space

Solar wind - magnetic plasma, fills space between sun and planets

Since the sun is moving, there is a front (bow shock) and back (heliotail) where the sun's atmosphere pushes and leaves behind a trail

Nothing is parallel in the solar system - earth is tilted relative to solar system, solar system tilted relative to galaxy

Aren't sure of total extend of the Milky Way galaxy, since it's too dark to see

Solar system --> Kuiper belt --> Oort cloud

Oort cloud consists of all the material that didn't make it when material collapsed into the sun

Space between the stars has gas and dust called **interstellar medium**

Very low density, but there's so much of it that we can measure the hydrogen in the interstellar medium
