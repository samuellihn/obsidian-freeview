Normal force is always acting perpendicular to the surface

Always parallel to the [[Surface Normal]] of the surface the object is resting on

Normal force is variable (can be changed)

Called "support" forces

Counteracts the force the object is exerting on the surface

> At an angle, gravitational force is **always** down, but normal force is **always** perpendicular to the surface
> 
> Use trigonometry to find the gravitational force that is perpendicular to the surface

Normal force differs when force is applied in the y direction

$$F_{N}=mg-F_{app_y}$$

If we apply force upward, the normal force will decrease

If we apply force downward, the normal force will increase

Normal force is **not** a force pair with gravitational force
