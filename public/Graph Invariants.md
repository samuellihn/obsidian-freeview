Some graph invariants:

- Number of vertices - $V(G)$
- Number of edges - $E(G)$
- Number of connected pieces
- Maximum degree - $\Delta(G)$
- Minimum degree - $\delta (G)$
- Degree sequence - an ordered list of the degrees of vertices (from highest to lowest, etc.)
- Vertex [[Connectivity]] $\kappa(G)$
- Edge [[Connectivity]] $\lambda(G)$
- [[Planar Graphs|Crossing Number]]
[[Proving Isomorphism|Isomorphic graphs]] must have **at least** these in common
