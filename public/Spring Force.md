Spring force is an interaction between an object and spring when the spring is compressed or expanded

The "neutral" position of a spring is called its **equilibrium position**

Magnitude of spring force depends on the amount of compression/expansion and the spring constant, $k$

> The direction of the force is **always** opposite the direction of the displacement
> If a spring is pulled to the right, the spring will exert force to the left

Spring forces are [[Static Equilibrium#Types of Forces|contact forces]] 

The greater the spring constant for a particular spring, the stiffer it is and the more it will resist the stretch
