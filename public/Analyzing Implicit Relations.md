The critical points of an implicit relation occur when $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ or  $\frac{dy}{dx} = undefined$ 

Remember:  can plug in either y or x to get the other value

Second derivative of implicit functions ($\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$) may include x, y, or $\frac{dy}{dx}$
> If you do not want $\frac{dy}{dx}$ involved, substitute it with the first derivative, which you should have if you are able to calculate the second derivative

When we plug things back in, we need to make sure that we don't get indeterminate forms
> Especially important with the first derivative which is usually a fraction

First derivative test does not apply with implicit relations
