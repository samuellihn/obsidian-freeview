[[Adjacency Matrix]] operations still apply here

For vertex degrees, there are now in-degrees and out-degrees

Total in-degrees and out-degrees will equal each other

> Which also equals $2 * |E|$

[[Isomorphism]] can still be found with directed graphs

In- and out-degree sequences/maxes can also count as new [[Graph Invariants]] that we can use
