1. See if anything can be proven by [[nth Term Test for Divergence]], if the limit is not zero it definitely converges
2. Then, check for [[Geometric Series]] using the [[Geometric Series Test]]
3. Then, [[Harmonic Series and P-Series]] are very straightforward
4. Only use [[Integral test for Convergence]] if the problem is easy to integrate, otherwise do not bother
5. If [[Factorial]]s are involved or exponents with a common base, use [[Ratio Test]]
6. If we see an [[Alternating Series]] (alternating series), use [[Alternating Series Test]]
