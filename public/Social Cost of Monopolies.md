$Q_0$ is the "socially optimal output", where the total surplus (consumer + producer) is the most

$Q'$ is the monopolistic output, where the monopoly produces at to maximize profit - this is less than the socially optimal output, and because of the price monopolies charge, consumer surplus is decreased while producer surplus is increased. 

> Because the quantity is inefficiently low, the price is inefficiently high, due to the downward-sloping demand curve - the monopoly wants this to happen

This also creates a deadweight loss (what could have been sold but isn't  because of monopolistic pricing practices

If a monopoly also needs to spend resources to maintain its monopoly, this money spent can be considered social loss as well
