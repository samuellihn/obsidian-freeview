To test a limit in 3 dimensions, follow a path that intersects the point of interest to see the function's behavior along the path

$$\lim_{(x, y) \to (0, 3)} = \frac{1-\cos{x}}{x (x+3)}$$

$$\lim_{(x, y) \to (0, 3)} = \frac{1-\cos{x}}{x (x+3)} \ along \ y = 3 \rightarrow 
\lim_{(x, y) \to (0, 3)} = \frac{1-\cos{x}}{x (x+3)}
$$
