A [[Geometric Series]] that reaches infinity when its upper bound is infinity is said to **diverge**

**A geometric series will diverge if $|r| \geq 1$**


However, if $|r| < 1$, the sum of infinitely many terms is:

$$
S_\infty = \frac{a_1}{1-r}
$$

> Make sure that $|r| < 1$! Only works in those cases
> Taking the limit of the general equation to find the sum of $n$ terms
