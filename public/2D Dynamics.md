Two perpendicular forces can be added together through trigonometry:
1. Find the length of the hypotnuse of the triangle created through the two forces
2. Find the angle that the hypotnuse creates
3. That is the resultant force vector

We can find two components form a force vector with an angle:

$$\sum F_y=\sin(\theta) *F_n$$
$$\sum F_x=\cos(\theta) *F_n$$


## Friction
Normal force changes, so friction changes as well

Make sure to calculate normal force correctly in a 2D context 

$$F_K=F_N*\mu_k=(mg-F_{app_y})*\mu_k$$
