Any function can be represented as a [[Power Series]] where:

$$
\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}{\frac{f^n(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n}
$$

> Note that $f^n(a)$ is the $nth$ derivative of function $f$ evaluated at point $a$
> Note that summation starts at 0, so the first term is $f(a)$

$$
f(a) + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3...
$$

The series is called a **MacLaurin series when $a = 0$** 

If a Taylor polynomial is centered at a value that means $a = the \ value$

The more terms, the more accurate it gets

Used to reduce more complex functions like logs, sqrt, trig functions into polynomials that can be computed with arithmetic
