The ratio test compares term $n$ and $n+1$ in a ratio:

If:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty}{\Bigg|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\Bigg|} = L
$$

If $L<1$ the series is absolutely convergent
if $L>1$ the series is conditionally convergent
If $L = 1$ the test is inconclusive

Remember that for a [[Factorial]], the $n+1$th term is equal to:

$$
(n+1)n!
$$

Remember the [[Complex Fraction Rules]] because most series will be fractions, and try to cancel out terms for numerator and denominator
