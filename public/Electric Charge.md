# Charging
An object gains charge if there are more positive (protons) or negative (electrrons) elements in its chemical composition

However, **charge is conserved**. Electrons taken out of one object will transfer onto other electrons

Electrons can be transferred:

- Frictionally, by rubbing
- Contact, when a positively charged object touches another and takes electrons wtih it

Sometimes, negatively charged objects can be attracted to neutral objects. Molecules reorient themselves, and the closer postiive particles will exbibit more attractive force than the farther negative particles

The neutral object is **polarized**

In **insulators** electrons cannot freely move: instead, the molecules simply reorient themselves

In **conductors** negative electorns will be repelled, polarizing the object: **induced charge separation**. Increases net attraction!

> In ICS, electrons never leave the object, they move to other parts

## Charging by Induction

Electrons are forced away by a negatively charged object

A **ground** is attached, so those electrons will flow into the ground due to repulsive force

After both the ground and the negatively charged object are taken away, the object is left with a postiive (opposite) net charge because it lose all its electrons

**Only happens with conductors**, the electrons must be able to move freely!
Initial negatively charged object **cannot touch anything**
Ground **must touch** so electrons can flow

Can also happen with a positively charged object, instead the electrons will attract and flow in reverse

**Conservation of Charge dictates that those electrons will be transferred between the two contacting objects**

If the object is touching, it is not induction. It is contact charging!
