The sum of the voltages across all capacitors in series will equal the battery voltage [[Kirchoff's Loop Rule]]

$$
V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + ...
$$

Therefore, the sum of all the $\frac{Q}{C}$ will equal the battery voltage.

Furthermore, all $Q$ will be the same, as the attractive force is transferred by each capacitor
> Positive terminal of battery attracts electrons of first capacitor, positive terminal of first capacitor attracts electrons of second capacitor, and so on
> Electrons cannot "jump" between capacitors, so all Q will be the same

Therefore,

$$
V = \frac{Q}{C_{eq}} = \frac{Q_1}{C_1} + \frac{Q_2}{C_2} + \frac{Q_3}{C_3}...
$$

> Note that $Q$ is **not distributed**  among the capacitors, but instead duplicated
> However, the voltage **is distributed ** among the capacitors ([[Kirchoff's Loop Rule]])

And since all Q are the same, the equivalent capacitance is:

$$
\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \frac{1}{C_3}...
$$
