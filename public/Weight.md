Weight (force) takes gravity in account, whereas mass does not

Mass is measured in $kg$, and weight is measured in $N$ which is equal to $\frac{kg*m}{s^2}$

Calculate weight given a mass with:
$$F_g = mg$$


**Net force is** the sum of all force vectors acting on the object

> Forces can cancel each other out

An object at rest has no net force acting on it

> Mass is not weight - mass is the same regardless of gravity (the amount of matter is the same)
