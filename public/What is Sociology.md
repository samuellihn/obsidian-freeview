**The study of social interaction...of its social foundations, its social effects, and its social structure, dynamics, and change over time.**

> Structure and dynamics - present 
> Change over time - past, present, future

Or, the study of **the social**: 
- Interaction by humans that takes into account other humans 
- The existence, identity, ideation of other humans

> Example - fighting for your country-interacting w/ the ideation of your country

What is NOT social interaction? reflex actions, (some) biological human actions.

However, the line of "social" is a bit hazy

**What sets sociology apart from social statistics?** **Social theories.**

> **Example: incumbency bias** - incumbents / well-known politicians are favored

**Theory** - general, abstract, extrapolatable statements/stories

**Sociology vs. journalism or history** - Sociologists try harder to abstract away

> Historians - systematic methods and facts
> Sociologists - develop theories of why

**A social effect is a social phenomenon.**

> **Social structure is the big picture** - class, race, gender, education, etc.
**Social dynamics are smaller, middle-range, and change over time** - past, present, and future

It is important to videw disciplines not as studying x/y/z, but as a way of asking questions about the world. Therefore,

**Sociology is considered  the application of the [[Sociological Imagination]]**
