On an inclined plane, the normal force will not be colinear with gravitational force

Therefore, we would have to "tilt" our x and y axes to align with the normal force

> Take the components of the gravitational force

We rotate the axes to align with the **normal force** because other forces (friction, etc,) are usually perpendicular or colinear with the normal force

> On an incline, the angle between the y-axis and the vector $mg$ is equal to the angle of the base of the incline
> - The side that is opposite to angle $\theta$ will always be parallel to the sliding direction
> - Therefore, gravitational force parallel to the incline will be equal to $mg * sin(\theta)$
