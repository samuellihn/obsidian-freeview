Resistance depends on:
- Cross-sectional area of wire (higher → **less** resistance)
- Material (higher [[Resistivity]] → more resist**ance**)
- Length (longer → more resistance)

Because [[Resistivity]] is dependent on temperature, so is resistance

> In general, colder → less resistivity

An **ohmic** resistor is one that obeys [[Ohm's Law]]
