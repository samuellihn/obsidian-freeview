The **production possibility curve** represents the combinations of two given goods that a society can produce will all its resources

**Important assumptions**:
- Two goods
- Resources are static
- Technology is static

Example of an (ideal, linear) PPF

How does a PPF reflect the [[Ten Principles of Economics]]?

- Margin - which one is marginally more efficient
- **Opportunity cost** - what do I have to give up to produce the other good?

$$
\text{cost} = \frac{\text{give up}}{\text{get}}
$$

Example:

$$
\text{cost} = \frac{-4 \ \text{phone}}{1\  \text{laptop}} = -4
$$
