A function $f$ is **integrable** when:
- $f$ is continuous on a **closed interval** $[a, b]$ 
**OR**
- $f$ is bounded on a **closed interval** $[a, b]$ and has a **finite number of discontinuities** on $[a, b]$

Jump discontinuities and removable disconuities are fine, because they are **bounded discontinuities** (don't go off to infinity)

Semantically, we still need to stop at these discontinuities and evaluate the parts on both sides as multiple parts, even for a removable discontinuity
