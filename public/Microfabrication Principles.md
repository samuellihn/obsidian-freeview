Microfabrication spans many orders of magnitudes, 100um to microns to nanometers

Some man-made nanostructures (e. g. nanomotors) are getting to the same scale as naturally occurring nanostructures

Richard Feynman - father of nanotechnology

Smaller transistors = cheaper ICs

> Wafer processing is approximately constant, but more devices can be packed into a single wafer with smaller features, reducing cost

Biomedical equipment following the same course as computers - from specialized facilities, to homes, to personal devices/point of care, medical wearables

Dream of biomedical diagnostics:

- Non-invasive
- Rapid diagnosis
- Compact and portable
- Painless

# What is microfabricaton?

Developed within IC industry's infrastructure, but now transcends research boundaries

Photolithography, highly parallel batch fabrication

Many length scales - 1nm - 1mm

Either material deposition, patterning, removal

F1

Fabrication processes are simply building blocks - can create electrical, mechanical, etc. devices

What is BioMEMS?

Creates many identical devices 

MIcro-fluidics, important applications will be in medicine and biology. Drug delivery, diagnostics all require fluid delivery systems
