The two most common Gaussian surfaces used in [[Gauss's Law]] are spheres and cylinders
Spheres are used for point or spherical charges, as $E$ will be uniform if the point charge is centered

Volume $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$
Surface Area $A = 4 \pi r^2$

Cylinders are used for charged rods where $E$ on the outside of the sphere will be uniform
The flux going through the top and bottom will be zero, because the surface normal and electric field vector are perpendicular

Volume $V = \pi r^2 h$
Surface Area $A = 2 \pi rh$ (Think of "unwrapping" the outer surface of the cylinder
