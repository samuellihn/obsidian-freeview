$$a_(n+1) = a + r$$
Adding $r$, a common separator. Linear. Always diverges

The recursive formula for an arithmetic series is:

$$\forall n \geq 1, s_n = s_{n-1} +r, s_0 = k$$

The explicit formula is:

$$\forall n \geq 0, s_n = s_0 + rn$$

For the series $2, 4, 6, 8, \dots$

The sequence be defined as:
$$\forall n \geq 1, s_n = s_{n-1} + 2, s_0 = 2$$
