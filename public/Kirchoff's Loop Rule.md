When going around a “loop” in a closed circuit, all voltages ([[Electrical Potential]]) will always add to zero

$$
\sum{V_{loop}} = 0
$$

**Remember that we are taking the vector sum!**
> Voltage **sources** (batteries) are positive, while voltage sinks (resistors, etc.) are negative

Relates to [[Conservation of Energy]]

A circuit with junctions may have multiple loops
A loop is simply a path an electron could take, nothing said about how many electrons, we treat them all the same

Nothing is said about the total potential **among all paths—make sure to consider one path at a time

> Loops do not need to contain a battery, this rule works for all loops so long as current is flowing

Can be used to solve for the voltage across a component (resistor, capacitor, battery, etc.)
