Once the switch is closed, electrons will leave the positive plate and gather at the negative plate

> Larger the resistor, the slower the capacitor will charge
> Larger the capacitor, the longer the capacitor will take to charge (more capacity)

$$Q_{final} = CE$$
> Voltage times capacitance
> Derived from [[Capacitance]] equation

Once the capacitor is fully charged, there will no longer be current through the circuit (all the current has gathered on the capacitor)

The more "empty" the capacitor is, the quicker it will charge (the easier it is to charge)

Once the capacitor starts filling up, the capacitor will charge slower as electrons build up and push back on other electrons

Current through the resistor is similar to the [[Discharging Capacitors]] graph (high initial current, lessens as capacitor starts to "fill up")
