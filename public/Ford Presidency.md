# Ford
18.6.1

Ford had a very long record of public service, serving in the military, then 25 years in congress, then House Minority Leader

Ford's nomination for VP was supported by both Democrats and Republicans and he had a very good reputation

Had to deal with reduced public faith in the government's integrity

U. S. also under severe economic pressure (oil, etc), the greatest since the Great Depression

Ford tried to face these problems but was mostly unsuccessful, left office with the problems still present and public still didn't trust the gov't 

Promised to continue Nixon's foreign policy advances and tried to restore public trust in gov't

Pardoned Nixon, under the accusation that it was a corrupt pardon, decreased Ford's popularity

Republicans lost many seats in the 1974 election because of public disapproval

## Economy
**Stagflation** continued to plague the nation with inflation hitting double digit numbers

Tried to fight it with a voluntary plan called WIN[^1], failed miserably with factories closing, demand dropping, many people lost jobs

## Foreign Policy

Many questioned American foreign policy and the need to fight communism while also supporting equally oppresive anticommunist governments

Ford maintained relations with the Soviet Union and his foreign policy was very similar to Nixon's, kept Henry Kissinger

Ford met with Brezhnev and both endorsed Helsinki Accords which were in favor of human rights. 

Ford also talked with Brezhnev about arms control which also led to **SALT II**, an agreement to limit nuclear weapon production

U. S. wanted to put Vietnam War behind it, did not intervene when Khmer Rouge killed 1.5 million Cambodian civilians

> Only intervention was when Khmer Rouge siezed an American merchant ship

Ultimately, South Vietnam fell to North Vietnam during Ford's presidency 

> Many South Vietnamese escaped in small boats. Over a million "**boat people**" sought refuge in SE Asia, U. S., Canada over the course of 20 years
