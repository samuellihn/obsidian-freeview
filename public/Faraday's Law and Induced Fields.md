As [[Magnetic Flux]] changes through a loop and according to [[Faraday's Law]] a current is induced, that induced current will also induce an [[Electric Field]]

This electric field is **non-electrostatic** - it is not caused by a buildup of positive/negative charge (static electrons) - it is an induced field caused by current (moving electrons)

> Electric field should be in the same direction as current flow

However, **the electric field is present whether there is a loop or wire or not** - as long as the magnetic field is changing, there will be an induced electric field
> If there's a wire, you get current **and** an electric field, but if there's no wire you just get the electric field

See [[Faraday's Law]] for the mathematical representation of this effect

In this problem $l$ is a circle with radius $r$, so our induced voltage is simply $EMF = E 2 \pi r$

Even if there is no wire, we can mock a Faradian loop to meaure the electric field (since a wire doesn't need to be present for a changing magnetic field to induce an electric field)

> Model the Faradian loop so it passes through the point which we want to measure
