How to determine limits for certain?

**For Piecewise Functions:**

You can plug in (direct substitution) for piecewise functions even if the specific "branch" of the piecewise function does not include a value

> So long as what you get is defined
> If both sides of the piecewise function match, the limit exists

Limits can be manipulated with [[Limit Theorems]]

**When can we not use limit theorems?**


What happens when one of the limits in a compound limit does not exist?

Try evaluating from both left and right

The + sides of a compound limit and the - sides of a compound limit may add/subtract/multiply/divide into a limit that exists

In this example, find $\lim_{x \to 2}{[f(x) + g(x)]}$

However, $\lim_{x \to 2}{f(x)}$ does not exist and $\lim_{x \to 2}{g(x)}$ does not exist

However, $\lim_{x \to 2^+}{f(x)} = -2$ and $\lim_{x \to 2^+}{g(x)} = -3$
Therefore, $\lim_{x \to 2^+}{[f(x) + g(x)]} = 1$

> The other side limit also agrees

Therefore, since both sides agree, we can conclude
$\lim_{x \to 2}{[f(x) + g(x)]} = 1$

Evaluating from both sides applies to all types of compound limits, as the [[Limit Theorems]] can be applied to all

> **Don't ever assume a limit (especially a compound limit) does not exists because one of its components does not exist!**
