A spherical coordinate system is a [[Parametric Equations & Polar Coordinates MOC|Polar Coordinate System]] with another angle that defines a 3D surface

$$P(\rho, \theta, \phi)$$
$\rho$ replaces $r$ for the magnitude of the vector

The $\theta$ angle starts off of the $+x$ axis, and the $\phi$ angle starts off the $+z$ axis

> Not an angle of elevation - be careful!

$$x = \rho \sin{\phi} \cos{\theta}$$
$$y = \rho \sin{\theta} \sin{\phi}$$
$$z = \rho\cos{\phi}$$
To calculate $r$ (projection of $\rho$ onto the $xy$-plane)
	
$$r = \rho \sin{\phi}$$

To convert from rectangular to spherical coordinates:

Similar to magnitude of vector equation
$$\rho^2  = x^2  + y ^2 + z^2$$
Calculating $\theta$ is exactly the same as for [[Cylindrical Coordinates]]

$$\tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x}$$

To calculate $\phi$, calculate the hypotnuse and adjacent of the triangle that has $\phi$ as the included angle

$$\phi = \frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}$$
