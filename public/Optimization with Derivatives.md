For systems with more than one independent variable, one variable needs to be solved in terms of the other. This is usually done wtih the given constraint

Then, [[Absolute Extrema]] can be found to find the ideal optimizationfor the modeled equation

Sometimes, checking the second derivative is needed.

Justification for [[Critical points]] (min, max) can be justified by plotting the first derivative, the second derivative (concavity), or logically.

Make sure to test both critical points **and end points** when the question has bounds : [[Derivative Tests#Candidate Test]]

Be sure to interpret the answer in context!

Superlative keywords can signify that the problem is an optimization problem
