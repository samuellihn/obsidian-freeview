Electrons move away from the nucleus of an atom when they have greater energy, just like gravity - more energy put in, higher

When an electron falls from a higher to lower level, the energy is released as electromagnetic radiation (wavelength/energy depends on how far the electron falls)

Every few million years, a hydrogen's electron will move slightly closer to the proton. It will release a wave with a wavelength of 21cm. Useful to detect neutral hydrogen in space

Because of the Doppler effect, the motion of the hydrogen can be found (toward - shorter wavelength, away - longer wavelength)
