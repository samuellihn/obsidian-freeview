The **absolute advantage** of production is if a country has higher capacity to produce a certain good

> Can produce a good earlier than another, or needs less workers to produce a unit of that good
> **More, Less time, Easier**

The **comparative advantage** of production is if a country has a lower [[Opportunity Cost]] of producing that good

Given two goods, a country **without the absolute advantage in both goods** can still have a comparative advantage in one good, and can therefore benefit from trade
