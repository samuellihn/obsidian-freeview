# Divergent (constructive) boundary

Plates move apart in opposite directions

Causes magma to flow upward, which then cools and forms new crust

Results in:
- Sea floor spreading
- Mountain range
- Volcano
- Rift valleys
- Earthquake

# Convergent (destructive) boundary

Plates move into one another and collide

Causes continental crusts to crumple and push up, forming a mountain range

May also cause **subduction**, where one plate is pushed underneath the other plate, one plate lifts up and one plate pushed down

Forms a deep trench next to a mountain range or volcano

The **subduction zone** is the location where the plate is pushed underneath

> The denser tectonic plate (if between continental and oceanic - the oceanic is denser) will be pushed underneath

The plate pushed underneath will melt into asthenosphere and become magma, destroys part of the plate

# Transform boundary

Plates slide in opposite directions, forming **fault line**

Plates are not [[#Divergent (constructive) boundary|constructed]] or [[#Divergent (constructive) boundary|destroyed]]

Causes pressure to build up as edges of tectonic plates lock and catch on each other

Eventually, the pressure overcomes the locked fault, releasing the stored energy and allowing the plates to slide past each other
