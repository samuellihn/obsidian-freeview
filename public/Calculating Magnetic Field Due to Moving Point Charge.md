To calculate the magnetic field caused by a moving point charge at a point,

Draw a vector from the point charge to the point we want to measure, call it vector $\vec{r}$

The vector $\vec{B}$ (magnitude **and** direction) can be calculated with:

$$
\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q\vec{v} \times \vec{r}}{r^3}
$$

> Again, notice the [[Cross Product]]

We can also write this as:

$$
|\vec{B}|=\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \frac{q\vec{v} \sin{\theta}}{r^2}
$$

> Since we can [[Magnetic Fields in Current-carrying Wires|know the magnitude]] using the right hand rule, we may not need to know the direction

This is why there is no magnetic field directly along the velocity path: $\vec{r}$ is parallel to $\vec{v}$ so $\sin{\theta} = 0$

$\mu_0 = 4 \pi \times 10^{-7}$ , so the coefficient for the equation is simply $10^{-7}$
