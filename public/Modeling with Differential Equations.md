Equations that contain derivatives

A differential equation involves derivatives that vary [[Inverse and Direct Relationships|inversely/directly]] to a value

The rate of change of a function which varies to the (transformed) value of that function

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{k}{y}
$$

or

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=kx
$$

> Example: rate of change of temperature varies directly to the temperature

**Be careful of what the rate of change is proportional to! Sometimes it's the function itself, sometimes it's the independent variable **
