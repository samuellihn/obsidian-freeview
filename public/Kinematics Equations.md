# First kinematics equation: 

$$v = v_0 + at$$

# Average Velocity Equation:

$$\bar{v} = \frac{v_i + v_f}{2}$$
> Only applies for constant acceleration in a straight line

# Second Kinematics Equation: 

Calculate the position of an object based on its initial position, the velocity, the time, and acceleration

$$x = x_0 = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$


# Third Kinematics Equation

$$v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(\Delta{x})$$

> Especially useful when time is unknown
