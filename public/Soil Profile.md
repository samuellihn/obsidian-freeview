Soil Layers are denoted by a diagram of the **soil horizons**

| Layer | Name                                 | Description                                                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| O     | Organic litter layer                 |                                                                                         |
| A     | Topsoil                              | Crucial for agriculture, ecosystems - high humus content and very nutrituous for plants |
| E     | Eluviation layer/leaching layer      |                                                                                         |
| B     | Subsoil                              | Where leached nutrients accumulate                                                      |
| C     | Weathered parent material            |                                                                                         |
| R     | Bedrock or weathered parent material |                                                                                         |

**Leaching** involves solid particles (with nutrients) dissolved in liquid that are transported to another location - increased significantly by acid rain
