**Marx - argues that communism is the next step in the progression of society's class structure**

> Feudalism to capitalism to communism to...

Expansion of means of exchange and commodities leads to accumulation of capital

> Especially the manufacturing system - workers no longer own means of production (machines, factories, etc.)

**Capital** - money that makes money

Advances in bourgeoisie are in step with political development - modern state manages the affairs of the bourgeoisie

Personal worth turns into exchange value - **labor is a commodity**

> Disconnects worker from the work

Marx argues micro-capitalists (tradesmen, artisans, etc.) sink gradually into the proletariat, because their capital doesn't match the scale of modern capitalism

Workers start off as a disorganized mass that fights each other to compete for work

Eventually, as their wages and working conditions lowe,r they form trade unions against the bourgeois to fight for better wages

The unions can win and gain members, but competition among the workers still weakens the labor movement so they don't fight against the capitalists

**Wage-labor** -  rests exclusively on competition between laborers - benefits the bourgeoisie

The **communist** aims to form the proletariat into a unified class, and overthrow the bourgeois to gain political power

Abolition of property relations (which are social relations in themselves) and the abolition of capitalist property (used to make money)

Capital is a social power that exploits wage-labor - it is **not** a personal power

Communism seeks to abolish **private** property, not personal property
