Most PPF/PPC's are **nonlinear**, meaning opportunity costs are no longer constant

This is because resources are non-transferrable (diminishing returns), meaning there is more waste at the "fringe"

The concavity of the PPF depends on how similar the goods are to produce - the degree to which the slope is flat determines how **strict** the tradeoff is

> Guns and Cheese - very concave, non-transferrable
> Phones and Laptops - fairly linear, transferrable goods and skills

It is **never** possible for the PPF to be concave up - Law of Increasing Opportunity Costs

PPF can shift outwards, if there is, in a country:

- Better technology or education
- More resources
- Greater population
