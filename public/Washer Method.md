Used when revolving a profile where one if the bounds is not the axis of rotation

In other words, when the [[Solids of Revolution (Disc Method)]] contains a "hole" or "dip" in the center

Can be solved by subtracting the missing material from the center

Subtracting the outer diameter from the inner diameter in each cross section

$$
(\pi outer^2 - \pi inner^2)
$$

If $f(x)$ is the outer function and $g(x)$ is the inner function

$$
\pi \int_a^b{(f(x))^2 - (g(x))^2}dx
$$

> Note that we start with two circle areas subtracted from each other, then factor out $\pi$, but DO NOT touch the squares

Don't mix up bounds: draw a picture, shade in the correct region
> The axis of revolution is **not always** a bound of the region

When rotating about an arbitrary line, use the [[Area Between Curves]] method for the inner and outer radii **separately**, then square and subtract
