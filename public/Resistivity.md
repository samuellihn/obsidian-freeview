A **material property** describing how much the material **resists** the flow of charge

$$
\rho = \frac{\vec{E}}{J}
$$

The amount of [[Electric Field]] needed for 1 $\frac{A}{m^2}$ of [[Current Density]]

Affected by temperature but nothing else

Metals that conduct electricity better will have **lower resistivity**

**Conductivity** is the reciprocal of resistivity

$$
Conductivity = \frac{1}{\rho}
$$

A material with high resistivity has low conductivity, and vice versa.
