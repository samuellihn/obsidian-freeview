A **parametric equation** is a collection of two functions, $x = x(t)$ and $y = y(t)$ of a third variable $t$ called the **parameter** that is defined on the same interval $I$

The graph of the points defined by:

$$
(x, y) = (x(t), y(t))
$$

Is called a **plane curve**

This represents **when** (time $t$) a graph reaches a specific point (ordered pair)

To find a value of $t$ given a coordinate pair $(x, y)$, equate $x$ with $x(t)$ and solve for $t$, do the same for $y$ and $y(t)$, and then pick values of $t$ where both equalities are true
