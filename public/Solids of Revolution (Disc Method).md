Take infinite slides of a function, find the area of a single slice, and add all slices

Slices ("discs") will be **coaxial** to the axis of revolution

The radius of each respective disk will be equal to the y-value of the function at that point.

The equation should look like this:

$$
\int_a^b{\pi R(x)^2}dx 
$$

Where the integral of $R(x)$ describes the bounded area of revolution, assuming the axis of revolution is directly below the revolved area.

If there's a gap between the axis of revolution and the inner edge, use the [[Washer Method]]


Just like with [[Volumes with Cross Sections]], if the axis of revolution is the x-axis (or any other horizonatal line), integrate with respect to x, if it's the y-axis (or any vertical line), integrate wtih respect to y

When integrating about arbitrary horizontal/vertical lines, use the [[Area Between Curves]] method (top minus bottom or right minus left)
