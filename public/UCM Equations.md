Centripetal Acceleration: 

$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Frictionless banked curves:

$$
tan\ \theta = \frac{v^2}{rg}
$$

Or its rearrangements


Kepler's second law: 

$$
\frac{r^3}{T^2} = \frac{GM}{4\pi^2}
$$

and

$$
\frac{r^3}{T^2}
$$ is constant for all satellites for a particular body with mass $M$
