Surface processes

Structures built up layer by layer from surface of silicon wafer

Structure (device) and sacrificial layer to create spaces

Sacrificial layer is like "support material" that is now etched away, also creates channels for structural layers to dissolve into 

Can create multiple sacrificial layers, and multiple structural layers 

Similar to dissolvable PVA support material - put everything in place, then dissolve it out to create mechanical structures

Overhangs are "microbridges"

Hinges usually used to direct light in optical devices, or sensors

Depositing films, patterning, and etching is classified as "machining" - although it isn't mechanical machining, etching is chemical machining

Many different types of surface micromachining materials - most common is polysilicon structural, SiO2 sacrificial, Hydroflouride etchant

Can also make metal structures, photoresist structures, other silicon and germanium. 

Digital mirror display (projector) uses SMM to make small aluminum mirrors

SMM structures are produced by micromachining foundries

Problem with SMM - stiction

**Stiction** - static friction between SMM structures and silicn substrate

Occurs when water surface tension pulls cantilevered structures to substrate and the structure bonds to substrate

Ways to reduce/eliminate: 

- Repel water to inhibit bonding
- Remove water by displacing with methanol, displace methanol with super critical CO2

Warping from residual stress can cause things to curl/bow
