# Metals

Crystalline with metallic bonds

[[Stiffness|Stiff]] - high [[Young's Modulus]]

[[Toughness|Tough]] - high $K_{Ic}$, and ductile

Very wide range of strengths, depends on chemical composition and material processing

Thermally and electrically conductive (due to metallic bonds)

Reactive - corrodes easily (some metals are used as electrodes)

Mostly used as alloys - pure material is rarely used
# Ceramics

Crystalline with ionic/covalent bonds

[[Stiffness|Stiff]] - high [[Young's Modulus]]

[[Hardness|Hard]] and abrasion resistant

[[Toughness|Brittle]]

Good strength and high temperatures

Corrosion resistance

Should not be loaded in tension (brittle)

# Glasses

**Non-crystalline (amorphous)** with ionic or covalent bonds

Other than that, very similar to ceramics - hard, brittle, corrosion resistant

Electrically insulating

Typically transparent
# Polymers

Long chain molecules with covalent and secondary (van der waal, etc.) bonds

> Bonds between chains are not very strong

Properties are highly sensitive to temperature (melts easily)

High strength per unit weight

Light weight, low density

Easily shaped

Not very stiff

# Elastomers

Like polymers, long chain molecules, but chains are **cross-linked**

Able to retain initial shape after significant stretching

Nonlinear elastic stress/strain

Strong and tough
# Hybrids

Properties are depending on combinations of materials

Difficult to shape and join

Expensive (carbon fiber, etc.)
