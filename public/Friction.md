-   Two types of friction: static and kinetic friction
-   Coefficients of friction are defined for a pair surfaces (an object and a surface)

Friction does not always act in the opposite direction of motion
> Sometimes, static friction can make objects move (if the objects they are resting on are moving)

## Static Friction
Seeks to maintain the original relative motion of the two objects
Makes things stay still
Rolling or non-moving friction
An object that has start moving has its applied force overcome its static frictional force

Then static friction becomes zero, but kinetic friction still remains

**For an object to move, applied force needs to be higher than the friction force**
$$F_f \leq u_sF_N$$

> Static friction is a variable force that depends on the applied force
-   **Contact area does not affect friction force**
	-   Only on material and mass (normal force)

## Kinetic Friction
Lower than static friction (the object has already started moving)
**Sliding friction between two objects**
$$F_f= \mu_kF_n$$
> Kinetic friction is constant
- When an object is moving at a constant speed, there is no acceleration

	- Therefore, there will be no net force - kinetic friction is equal to applied force
