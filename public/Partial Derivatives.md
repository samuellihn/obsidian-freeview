To take a partial derivative of a 3-dimensional function $f(x, y)$, constrain one of the variables and take the derivative of the function projected onto that plane (the cross-section)

For example, keeping $y$ fixed at $y_0$, and taking the **partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$**:

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}
$$

Which represents the partial derivative of $f(x, y)=z$ with respect to $x$

This can be used to easily take partial derivatives at a point:

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{(1, 0)} = k$$

$f_x$ means the derivative of $z$ **with respect to** $x$

To take partial derivatives over a general range (not at a point) with respect to $x$, treat $y$ as a constant (in the derivative)

> Don't apply the derivative rules such as the [[Power Rule]] to $y$ - the derivative of a constant is zero
