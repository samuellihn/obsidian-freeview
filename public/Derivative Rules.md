# Constant rule

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[c] = 0
$$

The slope of $y = c$ will always be zero no matter the value of $c$

# Sum and difference rules

$$
\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) \pm g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx}f(x) \pm \frac{d}{dx}g(x) 
$$

You can "break apart" derivatives and apply other rules (power, constant rules, etc.)

This and above rules also mean that you can drop the constant term when differentiating polynomials

# Constant Multiple Rule

$$
\frac{d}{dx} [cf(x)] = c\frac{d}{dx}f(x) 
$$
