How fast the electrons are moving

> Electrons **do not** travel in a straight line down a wire, the bounce around, but are still headed in one general direction (opposite to the electric field)

**Drift Velocity** is the average speed of the electrons in a particular current flow
$$v_d = \frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{t}}$$
