**Explicit functions** take on the form $y = f(x)$. $y$ is clearly defined as some manipulation of $x$ and is alone on one side

**Implicit functions** are not as clear. $x$ and $y$ can be on both sides of the equation

> A common example is the circle equation, $x^2 + y^2 = r$

Sometimes it is impractical or impossible to solve for $y$

If we cannot solve for $y$, we need to use **implicit differentation**

When differentiating a function with $y$, treat $y$ as if it were a function, where the derivative of $y$ is always $\frac{dy}{dx}$

Then, we can use the [[Chain Rule]] to take the derivative of the function

> For example, $\frac{d}{dx} [y^3] = 3y^2 \frac{dy}{dx}$

**Don't forget to take the derivative of both sides**

Then, all we need to do is solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Collect all $\frac{dy}{dx}$ on one side and factor.

We can also find the derivative given an x-y point by implicitly differentiating, plugging in the values for $x$ and $y$, and solving for $\frac{dy}{dx}$

This is easier because once the known values are substituted in, we only have to work with constants

The notation for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ at a point is:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} \Bigg|_{(x, y)}
$$

The vertical bar means "evaluated at"
