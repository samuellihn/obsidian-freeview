The earth's interior can be mapped with a **seismograph**, which records seismic waves to infer the properties of the Earth's deep interior

# Crust

Thinnest zone, 5-40 km thick

Made of solid rock, mostly $SiO_2$

Two types of crust:
- Oceanic - dense, made of igneous basalt
- Continental - thinner, less dense, made of igneous granite

> Continental plates vary based on terrain - thicker at mountains, thinner at coastlines

Lithosphere - Earth's shell, made of rigid plates, float on top of magma

Plates are known as tectonic plates, float on top of mantle

# Mantle

Middle layer made of dense, elastic rock

Made of iron, oxygen, silicon (called peridotite)

Solid at lower mantle, upper mantle is pliable

> Upper layer is known as the asthenosphere, a thick liquid layer of mantle

# Core

High temperature and high pressure

**Inner core** - solid, high temperature and pressure, made of nickel and iron
**Outer core** - liquid, cooler than inner core, made of nickel and iron

Rotation of the Earth causes molten iron in the core to circulate and become magnetized

> Creates the Earth's magnetic field
