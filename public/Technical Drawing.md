An **orthographic projection** divides up a 3D object into multiple 2D views

> U. S. standard - **third angle projection**

These behave like the objects are projected onto the side of an imaginary box

The **front view** is the "main" drawing - most information is communicated with this view

> Important features should be shown in solid (visible) lines, not hidden lines
