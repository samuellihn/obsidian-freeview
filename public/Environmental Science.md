Study of how the natural world works

How does our environment affect us?

How do we, as humans, affect the environment

How do we deal with environmental problems harming humans or nature?

> Different from [[Ecology]]

**Environment** is all living and nonliving things around us

Humans are a very large part of the environment

Constantly changing, though we depend on the environment being stable

An **anthoropogenic** change is caused by humans

Because humans rely on the ecosystem for its resources and services, we need to preserve the resources we have by understanding the limits to our exploitation of the environment

Important concept: **Environmental Unity** - everything in the environment is connected and any change will incite other changes

> Local changes can have global impacts

Most sytems in the environment tend towards equilibrium - many environemtnal problems are caused by human activity which disturbs the balance

The importance of the environment is usually overlooked until catastrophe (natural disasters, etc.) occurs
