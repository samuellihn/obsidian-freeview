38% of Earth's land surface is used for agricultural purposes

> 12% used for cropland - land used to raise plants
> 26% used for rangeland - land used for grazing livestock (pasture)

Much of tropical rainforest was converted into farmland 

> Ill-advised - tropical rainforest has a very thin topsoil layer which is bad for farmland

Negative impacts of agricultural land use:

- Soil erosion - wearing away topsoil
- [[Soil Conservation#Soil Degredation|Soil degradation]] - soil declines in productivity
- Soil salinization - by flooding irrigation techniques
- Desertification - fertile land loses productivity due to human activity and climate variations (strong wind, etc.)

> Dust bowl - increased erosion + strong winds = dust storms
