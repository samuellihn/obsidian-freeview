A definite integral represents the **net change in a function's antiderivative** according to the [[Fundemental Theorem of Calculus]]

$$
\int_a^b{f'(x)ds} = f(b) = f(a)
$$

When determining units, integrating a function multiplies the units by the unit of the independent variable

If $t$ is in weeks and $f$ is miles, 

$$
\int{\frac{miles}{weeks}} = \frac{miles\ *\ weeks} { weeks} = miles
$$

Usually an initial value is given to give a definite value from a net change
