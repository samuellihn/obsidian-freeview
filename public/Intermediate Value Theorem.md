#APCalcBC

- If $f$ is a continuous function on the closed interval $[a, b]$
- And $d$ is the number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$
- Then the intermediate value theorem **guarantees** that there is at least one number $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that $f(c)=d$

> Differentiability **implies** continuity
-   A continuous function between two points must cross the line between the y values of two points
    -   How else will it get to the second y-point?

> The function has to pass through every y value between the two at some point on the x axis
