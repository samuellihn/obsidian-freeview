Quantity and quality of species, genes, habitats, etc.
Due to **HIPPPPO**:

- Habitat Loss
- Invasive Species
- Pollution
- Poaching
- Pest Contorl
- (Human) Population
- Overexploitation (overconsumption) of resources

Caused in part by **invasive species**, species that outcompete the native populations and become dominant

> Eat them, take their food, native species eventually become distinct

We may be in the midst of a sixth mass extinction because of human (**anthropogenic**) causes
