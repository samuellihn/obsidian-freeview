<p><strong>17.2.1</strong></p>
<p>Operation Rolling Thunder (1965): Bombing campaign against North Vietnam, caused widespread destruction</p>
<p>US soldiers began to take more dominant role in fighting, South Vietnamese forces became secondary: US war, "Americanize" the war effort</p>
<p>Dropped 6 million tons of bombs, 3x that of all combatants during WWII</p>
<p>Dropped Agent Orange and napalm</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agent Orange</strong>: killed forests and plant life to reduce Vietnamese advantage, caused health issues to locals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ground fights were mostly small skirmishes, Ho Chi Minh's soldiers fought light and executed small guerilla attacks against Americans, hoping the Americans would eventually give up and leave</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tiger and Elephant” analogy—Tiger could slowly wear down elephant with small attacks</p>
<p>Vietnam also has time on their hands, while US involvement continues to bleed money</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than 500k US troops in Vietnam by 1968, almost no success</p>
<p>South Vietnamese government had very little support, little progress in defeating North Vietnamese</p>
<h1>Sinking Morale</h1>
<p><strong>17.2.2</strong></p>
<p>Vietnam War was not about territorial acquisition - no invasion of North Vietnam</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In hopes that Soviets or Chinese did not enter conflict if US invaded</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Guerilla Warfare</strong>: Small surprise skirmishes that benefitted from increased knowledge of the landscape</p>
<p>The US had no choice but to fight indecisive battles in the wilderness, often surprised by Vietcong</p>
<p>Many began to question US involvement as many had been drafted into service</p>
<p>Vietnam was also unwilling to defend themselves</p>
<h1>Doubt on the Home Front</h1>
<p><strong>17.2.3</strong></p>
<p>Lack of progress led to doubt among the US population, losing to a county as small as Vietnam</p>
<p>War took away from Great Society plan to fight poverty, improve education, etc., money was simply not enough to supply both the war and Great Society</p>
<p>Government spending lowered unemployment rate, but led to rising prices and inflation</p>
<p>Because of heavy government spending and inflation, Johnson had to raise taxes and cut back on Great Society</p>
<p>Because of this, antiwar movement emerged both in Congress and among the US population</p>
<p>Eventually, two schools of thought:</p>
<p>Hawks | Doves<br>
-- | --<br>
Supported Johnson's War Policy | Did not support escalation<br>
Believed in Domino Theory | Thought US was fighting local Civil War<br>
Strongly anticommunist | Did not think Vietnam was a vital anticommunist battleground<br>
Conservative men | Liberals, pacifists, students, civil rights leaders</p>
<p>J. William Fulbright emerged as leader of Doves, initially supported Gulf of Tonkin but soon thought Vietnam was a localized Civil War</p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"mdContent":"\u003ch1\u003eEscalation of forces in Vietnam\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e17.2.1\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOperation Rolling Thunder (1965): Bombing campaign against North Vietnam, caused widespread destruction\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUS soldiers began to take more dominant role in fighting, South Vietnamese forces became secondary: US war, \"Americanize\" the war effort\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropped 6 million tons of bombs, 3x that of all combatants during WWII\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropped Agent Orange and napalm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAgent Orange\u003c/strong\u003e: killed forests and plant life to reduce Vietnamese advantage, caused health issues to locals\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGround fights were mostly small skirmishes, Ho Chi Minh's soldiers fought light and executed small guerilla attacks against Americans, hoping the Americans would eventually give up and leave\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tiger and Elephant” analogy—Tiger could slowly wear down elephant with small attacks\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVietnam also has time on their hands, while US involvement continues to bleed money\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than 500k US troops in Vietnam by 1968, almost no success\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouth Vietnamese government had very little support, little progress in defeating North Vietnamese\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eSinking Morale\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e17.2.2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVietnam War was not about territorial acquisition - no invasion of North Vietnam\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn hopes that Soviets or Chinese did not enter conflict if US invaded\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGuerilla Warfare\u003c/strong\u003e: Small surprise skirmishes that benefitted from increased knowledge of the landscape\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe US had no choice but to fight indecisive battles in the wilderness, often surprised by Vietcong\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany began to question US involvement as many had been drafted into service\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVietnam was also unwilling to defend themselves\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eDoubt on the Home Front\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e17.2.3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLack of progress led to doubt among the US population, losing to a county as small as Vietnam\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWar took away from Great Society plan to fight poverty, improve education, etc., money was simply not enough to supply both the war and Great Society\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGovernment spending lowered unemployment rate, but led to rising prices and inflation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of heavy government spending and inflation, Johnson had to raise taxes and cut back on Great Society\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, antiwar movement emerged both in Congress and among the US population\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, two schools of thought:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawks | Doves\u003cbr\u003e\n-- | --\u003cbr\u003e\nSupported Johnson's War Policy | Did not support escalation\u003cbr\u003e\nBelieved in Domino Theory | Thought US was fighting local Civil War\u003cbr\u003e\nStrongly anticommunist | Did not think Vietnam was a vital anticommunist battleground\u003cbr\u003e\nConservative men | Liberals, pacifists, students, civil rights leaders\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJ.
