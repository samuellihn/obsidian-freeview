<p><strong>17.2.1</strong></p>
<p>Operation Rolling Thunder (1965): Bombing campaign against North Vietnam, caused widespread destruction</p>
<p>US soldiers began to take more dominant role in fighting, South Vietnamese forces became secondary: US war, "Americanize" the war effort</p>
<p>Dropped 6 million tons of bombs, 3x that of all combatants during WWII</p>
<p>Dropped Agent Orange and napalm</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Agent Orange</strong>: killed forests and plant life to reduce Vietnamese advantage, caused health issues to locals</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ground fights were mostly small skirmishes, Ho Chi Minh's soldiers fought light and executed small guerilla attacks against Americans, hoping the Americans would eventually give up and leave</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tiger and Elephant” analogy—Tiger could slowly wear down elephant with small attacks</p>
<p>Vietnam also has time on their hands, while US involvement continues to bleed money</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than 500k US troops in Vietnam by 1968, almost no success</p>
<p>South Vietnamese government had very little support, little progress in defeating North Vietnamese</p>
<h1>Sinking Morale</h1>
<p><strong>17.2.2</strong></p>
<p>Vietnam War was not about territorial acquisition - no invasion of North Vietnam</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In hopes that Soviets or Chinese did not enter conflict if US invaded</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Guerilla Warfare</strong>: Small surprise skirmishes that benefitted from increased knowledge of the landscape</p>
<p>The US had no choice but to fight indecisive battles in the wilderness, often surprised by Vietcong</p>
<p>Many began to question US involvement as many had been drafted into service</p>
<p>Vietnam was also unwilling to defend themselves</p>
<h1>Doubt on the Home Front</h1>
<p><strong>17.2.3</strong></p>
<p>Lack of progress led to doubt among the US population, losing to a county as small as Vietnam</p>
<p>War took away from Great Society plan to fight poverty, improve education, etc., money was simply not enough to supply both the war and Great Society</p>
<p>Government spending lowered unemployment rate, but led to rising prices and inflation</p>
<p>Because of heavy government spending and inflation, Johnson had to raise taxes and cut back on Great Society</p>
<p>Because of this, antiwar movement emerged both in Congress and among the US population</p>
<p>Eventually, two schools of thought:</p>
