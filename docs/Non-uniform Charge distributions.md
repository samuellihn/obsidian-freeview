To fnd the flux through a Gaussian where the charge is non-uniform, divide the volume of the Gaussian into infinitely small volumes and integrate over the volumes accounting for the function that determines the charge density

For a cylinder, if $\rho(r)$ is the function that determines the charge density as a function of radius, then divide a cylinder into infinitely small cylindrical shells (hoops) and integrate over $\rho(r) * dV$ 

> $dV$ is the volume of each infinitely small cylindrical shell

From there, the $dV$ can be turned into $H * 2\pi r dr$ (imagine unrolling one of the cylindrical sections)

Therefore, our integral can be:

$$
q_{en} = \int_a^b{\rho(r) H2\pi r dr}
$$

Setting up [[Gauss's Law]]:

$$
\frac{\int_a^b{\rho(r) H2\pi r dr}}{\epsilon_0} = E 2\pi r_g H
$$

 > Where $r_g$ is the radius of the Gaussian cylinder
