The derivative of position is velocity
The derivative of velocity is acceleration

The [[1.2-Representations-1of-Motion#1 2 Representations of Motion - Acceleration|Rule of Two]] can be used to find whether an object is speeding up or slowing down

**At rest** means that the velocity is zero $v(t)=0$

The positive direction is always to the **right** unless stated otherwise

The **origin** is always $x(t)=0$

The **distance** travelled by an object equals the integral of the **absolute value** of its velocity (the speed)

$$d = \int{|v(t)|dt}$$

> Whereas the **displacement $\Delta{x}$** is the integral of the velocity of the object
> $$\Delta x = \int{v(t)}dt$$



The [[Integrals|integral]] of an object's velocity is its displacement, and the definite integral of an object's acceleration is its velocity

$$x'(t) = v(t)$$
$$x(t) = \int_{a}^{t}v(x)dx$$
