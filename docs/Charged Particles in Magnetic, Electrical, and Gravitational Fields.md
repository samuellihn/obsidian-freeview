Moving charged particles can be influenced by [[Electric Field]]s, [[Gravitational Field]]s, and [[Force on a Charged Particle in a Magnetic Field|Magnetic Fields]] all at the same time:

$$
\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times B + q\vec{E} + m\vec{g}
$$

> Most of the time, since the particles are small, gravitational fields are negligible/ignored
