Type | Characteristics | Examples
---|---|---
Perpetual | Renewed continuously | solar, wind, water
Renewable | Replenished naturally, as long as consumption is less than or matches generation | forest, fertile soil, animals, freshwater
Nonrenewable | Cannot be replenished sustainably; fixed amount of resources, or generates extremely slowly | fossil fuels

> A note on water: water can either be a perpetual or renewable resource depending on the context. For example, potable water is renewable as the water cycle takes time to take place, but ocean water/saltwater is perpetual, we can use as much as we want without affecting that supply
