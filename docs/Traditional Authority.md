Authority by "the sanctity of age-old rules and powers" - typically unwritten

Patriarchal or estates (two types)

Personal loyalty to master's honor, or tradition
Hereditary, typically stable/from transferrable
Becoming irrelevant w/ industrialization

# Patriarchalism 

**All servants/staff depend completely and personally on the master**

Simplest form of traditional authority

The master has **formally arbitrary** power

# Estate system

**Servants under master are traditional lords themselves**-feudalism

Subordinate lords w/ own social status

More hierarchical

Privilege or concession officially bestowed by the master

Closer to [[Legal-rational Authority]]
## Patrimonialism

Master governs large entity (government) and relies on loyal bureaucracy.

Power is **still formally arbitrary**

Expectation and reward for loyalty to master.

For master, "what is the state's is mine."
