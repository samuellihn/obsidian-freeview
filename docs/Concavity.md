If $f$ is a function that iis continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$:

- Concave up on $(a, b)$ if $f$ lies above each tangent line throughout $(a, b)$
- Concave down on $(a, b)$ if $f$ below above each tangent line throughout $(a, b)$

Concave up -> slopes of $f'(x)$ are increasing -> $f''(x) > 0$
Concave down -> slopes of $f'(x)$ are decreasing -> $f''(x) < 0$

An **inflection point** is a point where the concavity changes S
> $f''(x)$ must change signs and will be 0 or undefined at that point
> A "bounce" of the x-axis doesn't count
> $f''(x)=0$ is not sufficient justification because it might be a "bounce"

Concavity is always defined in **open intervals** (with parenthesis)
