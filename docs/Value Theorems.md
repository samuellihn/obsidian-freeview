Theorem | Conditions | Meaning
--- | --- | --- 
[[Intermediate Value Theorem]] | $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $f(a) < d < f(c)$ | $f(c) = f(x)$ at some value of $c$
[[Mean Value Theorem]] | $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$ and $a < c < b$ | $\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = f'(c)$, AROC = IROC at some point $c$
[[Extreme Value Theorem]]| $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ | There is a local minimum and maximum on the interval $[a, b]$
