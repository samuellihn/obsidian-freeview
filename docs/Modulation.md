[[Analog Signals|Analog]] transmission technique
**Superimpose a lower frequency message** (bearing signal) with a higher frequency carrier signal for transmission

it is impractical to transmit low-frequency signals over the airwaves (low frequency signals do not radiate over the airwaves)

- Can use smaller antennae to radiate higher frequencies 
$$ Antanne \ length = \frac{\lambda}{4}$$

Of course the signal has to be **demodulated** (decoded) at the other end

Reduces the width of frequencies needed to carry low frequencies, like voice signals


The **modulating signal** is the low-frequency signal
The **carrier signal** is the high-frequency signal
> The carrier signal usually does not change and is simply an oscillator

Modulars are also known as **up converters**
