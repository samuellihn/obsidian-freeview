When finding the area bounded by two curves, we are finding **total area**

Effectively "flipping the signs" of the bottom curves that end up belo the y-axis

Instead of finding the integral of the two functions (one below and above the y-axis), we can do:

$$\int_a^b{f(x) - g(x)} dx$$
> Where $f(x)$ is the top function and $g(x)$ is the bottom function

However, it may be beneficial to flip the problem on its side when we have $x=$ equations
Integrate with respect to $dy$, with $f(y)$ being the right function and $g(y)$ being the left

$$\int{f(y) - g(y)} dy$$
However, we need to also transform the bounds of the problem (the points of intersection)
> Solved algebraically by setting them equal to each other

$$\int_c^d{f(y) - g(y)} dy$$
