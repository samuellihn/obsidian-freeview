The null space of a matrix $A$ is the set of all solutions of $A\vec{x} =0$ (the [[Homogenous System]]), denoted $Nul \ A$

> Note: the **solutions** are $\vec{x}$ - different from [[Column Space]]!

To find if an arbitrary vector $\vec{b}$ is in the null space of matrix $A$, determine if:

$$A\vec{b} = \vec{0}$$
