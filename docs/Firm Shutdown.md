[[Profit Maximization|When market price is less than marginal cost, the firm should decrease output]]

However, marginal cost must be **at least** average variable cost

$$MC > AVC$$

Therefore, if market price is below average variable cost, the firm should shut down

$$P < AVC \rightarrow \text{Shutdown}$$
> At any production level, the firm will lose money, so it's better just to minimize cost and shut down

As a result, the supply curve is any price above the average variable cost (in the short run) and equal to marginal cost

However, the firm still needs to pay fixed costs, even though its total variable cost is zero (from zero production) - these fixed costs (with no output/profit) are called **sunk costs**
