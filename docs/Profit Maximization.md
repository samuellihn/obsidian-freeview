$$\pi = TR - TC$$

To maximize profit, we need to find the point where total revenue is maximized and total cost is minimized

When $MR > MC$, the firm should increase output, as each additional unit will make them money

When $MR < MC$, the firm should decrease output, as additional units lose them money

Therefore, the firm should produce at a point where $MR = MC$, which is where [[Perfect Competition|marginal revenue]] (market price) equals marginal cost
