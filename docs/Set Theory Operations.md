 Union: $A \cup B$ - the set of all elements that are in either set $A$ or set $B$, or in both. 
 
 > For example, if $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {3, 4, 5}$, then $A \cup B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$.
 
 Intersection: $A \cap B$ - the set of all elements that are in both set $A$ and set $B$. 
 
 > For example, if $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {3, 4, 5}$, then $A \cap B = {3}$.

 Complement: $A^c$ or $\bar{A}$ - the set of all elements that are not in set $A$. 
 
 > For example, if $A = {1, 2, 3}$, then $A^c = {x : x \notin A} = {4, 5, 6, \dots}$.
 
 Difference: $A \setminus B$ or $A - B$ - the set of all elements that are in set $A$ but not in set $B$. 
 
 > For example, if $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {3, 4, 5}$, then $A \setminus B = {1, 2}$.
 
 Exclusive or: $A \Delta B$ or $A \oplus B$ - the set of all elements that are in either set $A$ or set $B$, but not in both. 
 
 > For example, if $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {3, 4, 5}$, then $A \Delta B = {1, 2, 4, 5}$.
 
 Cartesian product: $A \times B$ - the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a$ is in set $A$ and $b$ is in set $B$. 
 
 > For example, if $A = {1, 2}$ and $B = {3, 4}$, then $A \times B = {(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)}$.

 Power set: $\mathcal{P}(A)$ - the set of all subsets of set $A$, including the empty set and $A$ itself. 
 
 > For example, if $A = {1, 2}$, then $\mathcal{P}(A) = {\emptyset, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}$.
