For a [[Vector Function]], independent variable $t$ will represent time in  [[Position, Velocity, Acceleration]] problems, and the function will represent **motion along a curve**

Position vector will be $\hat{r} = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle$
> Velocity and acceleration vectors are [[Differentiating Vector Function|derivatives of this vector function]]

Speed will be the magnitude of $\hat{v}$

$$
s(t) = |\hat{v}(t)| = \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2}
$$

> Distance function

Think about the two functions, both functions of $t$, acting in tandem

These can also be presented as [[Parametric Equation]]s

> May also be asked to convert between parametric and vector forms

We can also go the other way, by integrating velocity, speed, and acceleration to find the distance/displacement of the motion

**Total Distance Travelled** is a special case,0 because we cannot simply plug values into $x(t)$:

$$
\int{s(t)} = \int{|\hat{v}(t)|} = \int{\Bigg[\sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2}\Bigg]} = total \ distance \ travelled
$$

> Usually, this will not need to be integrated by hand
