Use [[Kirchoff's Loop Rule]] and [[Kirchoff's Junction Rule]] to generate equations for the unknowns

Assign names to the current flowing through each path

> Generate as many equations as you have unknowns and solve algebraically

Use [[Ohm's Law]] so you can solve for resistance, voltage, etc

Remember that batteries can either drop or increase voltage depending on their polarity

For voltage, choose the path that has the least components as it will make it much easier to solve the problem
