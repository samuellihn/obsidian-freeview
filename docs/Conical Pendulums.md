Conical pendulums sweep out a ciruclar path
The string sweeps out a cone among one revolution

Tension force on string has two components, the centripital force and the complement to the gravitational force

[[Static Equilibrium#Equilibrium|Equilibrium state]] in y-direction, motion in x-direction

$$
v = \sqrt{gr\tan{\theta}}
$$

To find the tension in the string,

$$
T^2=(mg)^2+(\frac{mv^2}{r})^2
$$
