**How sensitive consumer demand is to changes in price, for a given market**

> Responsiveness of buyers in $Q_D$ when $P \updownarrow$

Elastic: $E > 1$: consumers are more responsive than the price change
Inelastic: $E < 1$: consumers are less responsive than the price change

**Why is elasticity useful?**

> Whenever the price of the good changes, understanding the elasticity is important - **Predictive** power of the model, determines the size of change in consumer demand

The elasticity determines the total **[[Revenue]]** of a particular product

# Determinants of elasticity

Availability of substitutes

> More substitutes - more responsive/elastic

Luxury or necessity

> We don't need luxuries, so can do without them when price changes and wait until the price goes downagain
> $E_D < 1$ - necessity
> $E_D > 1$ - luxury

Budget (share of income) spent on good

> Higher share of income = more elastic
> Change in price of Spotify subscription vs. change in price of new cars

Time horizon

> Over time, alternatives arise and preferences change

# Formulas

Given percentages:

$$
E_{D} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_{D}}{\%\Delta P}
$$

Midpoint Formula: 

$$
E_{D} = \frac{(Q_{D_{2}} - Q_{D_{1}})(P_{1} + P_{2})}
{(Q_{D_{1}} + Q_{D_{2}})(P_{2} - P_{1})}
$$

At a point:

$$
E_{D} = \frac{\Delta Q_{D}}{\Delta P} \times \frac{P}{Q_{D}}
$$

# Four classifications

**$E_D = 0$ - Perfectly Inelastic (not responsive at all to price change)**

> Lifesaving drugs, baby food (people will buy no matter what)

**$E_D < 1$ - Inelastic**

> Less responsive to price change

$E_D = 1$ - **Unit Elastic**

**$E_D = \infty$ Perfectly Elastic**

> Binary states - either don't buy it at all, or buy all of it
> **Example: currency** (would you buy a $10 bill for $9?)
