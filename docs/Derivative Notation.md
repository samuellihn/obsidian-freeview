A function whose value is equal to for all $x$

$$
\lim_{h \to 0} {\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}}
$$

is called the **derivative** of $f(x)$, also known as $f'(x)$

$$
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} {\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}}
$$

Or, alternatively, for a derivative at a point

$$
\lim_{x \to a}{\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}}
$$

If $y = f'(x)$, the notation for $f(x)$ can be:
- $f'(x)$
- $y'$
- $\frac{dy}{dx}$
- $\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$

The value for $f(x)$ at point $x$ is the slope of the tangent line at point $x$


Derivatives can be found by analyzing graphical, numerical and verbal representations

Horizontal tangents occur on the graph of a function where the derivative equals zero

Watch for the definition of the derivative when asked to solve a limit: you may only need to take the derivative using a shortcut!
