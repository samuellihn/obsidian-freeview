Like [[Gauss's Law]], but for magnetic fields, not electric fields
- Both for symmetric situations
- Uses closed loops, not closed surfaces (Gaussians)

$$ \mu_0 I = \oint{\vec{B} \cdot \vec{dl}}$$
> This time, $\oint$ is the **closed path integral**

$I$ is the current that goes through the Amperian membrane
$\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field on the Amperian Loop
$\vec{dl}$ is an infinitesimally small segment of the current path (wire)

Same process as solving [[Gauss's Law]]:
1. Get rid of dot product, using mocked symmetry
2. Make $\vec{B}$ the same for every point on the Amperian loop
3. Integrate $dl$


The **Amperian loop** is a closed shape that mocks symmetry so we can get rid of the dot product

The **Amperian membrane** is the "area" enclosed inside the Amperian loop, so we only count the current that flows **inside** our loop

The $dl$ and $B$ can cancel the dot product if the field and the lengths are parallel 
> Pick $dl$ to be in the same direction (since the length has no direction, either "forward" or "backward", we can make one up)
