<p>17.3.1</p>
<p>More troops were being sent, more soldiers died</p>
<p>Divided Americans more deeply than any conflict since the Civil War</p>
<p>By 1965, most men being sent were draftees (>1.5 million drafted)</p>
<h2>Against Draft</h2>
<p>Draft was unfair: granted deferments to college students, certain occupations, and rich people</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most drafted were poor, working class<br>
African Americans also very high, deaths were disproportionately high and were given menial tasks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MLK Jr. spoke out against war burden to African Americans and poor people</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Able to fight and die together but not able to go to the same schools</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL;DR: Inequalities in draft led to widespread resistance to it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some burned draft cards<br>
Stop the Draft Week: October 1967</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>On College Campuses</h2>
<p>College campuses became a major protest ground against the war</p>
<p>Many more students enrolled in college, college students became their own individual class</p>
<p>26th Amendment: "old enough to fight, old enough to vote" allowed 18 to 20-year-olds to fight</p>
<h2>In Media</h2>
<p>Antiwar sentiment the result of media's coverage, many Americans had TV sets and could closely watch progress of the war</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First "Living Room War"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brutal reality of war broadcast into American homes, messy conflict wtih no objective or progress</p>
<p><strong>Credibility Gap</strong>; between what Johnson administration said and what journalists/tv said about it, grew distrust of US government's statements</p>
<h1>Tet Offensive</h1>
<p>17.3.2</p>
<p>General Westmoreland said that Vietcong were defining in strength, could no longer mount a major offensive. <strong>He was wrong.</strong><br>
1968</p>
<p>Tet Offensive: coordinated assault on provincial capitals and major cities in South Vietnam, and also the <strong>US Embassy in Saigon</strong></p>
<p>Planned to hold cities until US gave up and war ended</p>
<p>US and South Vietnam were able to fight off the offensive, but still showed the world that the Vietcong was not weakening</p>
<p>American leaders were less confident of a quick end to the war</p>
<p>US SoD thought war was "bottomless pit"</p>
<p><strong>Turning point of war</strong>, suggesting that US should pursue peace instead of victory</p>
<p>Because of this failure, Johnson did not seek recollection as war was undermining his presidency</p>
<p>Eugene McCarthy (Democratic antiwar candidate), Robert Kennedy also campaigned</p>
<p><strong>Johnson announced that US would limit bombing of N. Vietnam and seek negotiated sentiment, and also announced he would not run for president</strong></p>
<h1>1968 Election</h1>
<p>17.3.3</p>
<p>Robert Kennedy assassinated, he cannot run for president anymore</p>
<p>Democrats nominated Hubert Humphry, just as Chicago antiwar protestors fought outside the convention—Democrats were weakened significantly as the event was televised</p>
<p>Republicans nominated Richard Nixon under the platform of "peace with honor", getting the US out of the war on honorable peace terms</p>
<p>Promised to listen to non-protesting “silent majority” and convinced more Southern voters as they appealed to law and order</p>
<p>George Wallace also ran, desired to press forward to victory in Vietnam, overall racist</p>
<p>Third-party by Wallace and Nixon's undermining of traditional Southern Democrat support siphoned Democrat votes away from Humphrey</p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"mdContent":"\u003ch1\u003eAntiwar Sentiment Grows\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17.3.1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore troops were being sent, more soldiers died\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDivided Americans more deeply than any conflict since the Civil War\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy 1965, most men being sent were draftees (\u003e1.5 million drafted)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAgainst Draft\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraft was unfair: granted deferments to college students, certain occupations, and rich people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost drafted were poor, working class\u003cbr\u003e\nAfrican Americans also very high, deaths were disproportionately high and were given menial tasks\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMLK Jr. spoke out against war burden to African Americans and poor people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAble to fight and die together but not able to go to the same schools\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTL;DR: Inequalities in draft led to widespread resistance to it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome burned draft cards\u003cbr\u003e\nStop the Draft Week: October 1967\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOn College Campuses\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCollege campuses became a major protest ground against the war\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany more students enrolled in college, college students became their own individual class\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26th Amendment: \"old enough to fight, old enough to vote\" allowed 18 to 20-year-olds to fight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIn Media\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntiwar sentiment the result of media's coverage, many Americans had TV sets and could closely watch progress of the war\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst \"Living Room War\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutal reality of war broadcast into American homes, messy conflict wtih no objective or progress\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCredibility Gap\u003c/strong\u003e; between what Johnson administration said and what journalists/tv said about it, grew distrust of US government's statements\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eTet Offensive\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17.3.2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral Westmoreland said that Vietcong were defining in strength, could no longer mount a major offensive. \u003cstrong\u003eHe was wrong.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n1968\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTet Offensive: coordinated assault on provincial capitals and major cities in South Vietnam, and also the \u003cstrong\u003eUS Embassy in Saigon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlanned to hold cities until US gave up and war ended\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUS and South Vietnam were able to fight off the offensive, but still showed the world that the Vietcong was not weakening\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmerican leaders were less confident of a quick end to the war\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUS SoD thought war was \"bottomless pit\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTurning point of war\u003c/strong\u003e, suggesting that US should pursue peace instead of victory\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this failure, Johnson did not seek recollection as war was undermining his presidency\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene McCarthy (Democratic antiwar candidate), Robert Kennedy also campaigned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJohnson announced that US would limit bombing of N.
