The standard form for the equation of a plane in $R^3$ is:

$$
ax + by + cz + d = 0
$$

Where $a, b, c, d$ are real number constants. 

> See [here](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/EqnsOfPlanes.aspx) for derivation

If you divide by $d$, you get:

$$
\frac{a}{d}x + \frac{b}{d}y + \frac{c}{d}z + 1 = 0
$$

or

$$
Ax + By + Cz = -1
$$

To find the equation of the plane given 3 points, we need values of $A, B, C$ where the equation holds true at all three points ($Ax + By + Cz = -1$)
