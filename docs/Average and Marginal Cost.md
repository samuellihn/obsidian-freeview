The **average cost** is the [[Fixed and Variable Cost|total cost]] divided by the quantity produced

Average fixed costs are always decreasing (albeit at a decreasing rate), as the fixed cost will be spread out over 

The **marginal cost** is the change in cost when the output quantity is increased by one unit

$$MC = \frac{\Delta TC }{\Delta Q}$$

The **rising marginal cost** curve reflects diminishing returns - it will be increasingly more expensive to produce more units of goods

Average total cost is U-shaped, as it initially decreases due to falling AFC, but then increase due to rising AVC

When marginal cost is below ATC, ATC falls. When marginal cost is above ATC, ATC increases - **due to this, the marginal cost crosses average total cost at at its minimum**

$$ATC_{min} \rightarrow MC = ATC$$
For non-ideal firms, the marginal cost is check-shaped

Firms experience increasing marginal product (rising part of production function) and average variable costs decrease for a bit before they rise
