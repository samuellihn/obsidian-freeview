Material phases:

- Crystalline: repetitive unit cell 
	- Salts, silicon, sugar
	- Long range order - atoms are always in known position
- Polycrystalline: 
	- Individual grains of crystalline material
	- Short range order - only orderly in an individual grain
- Amorphous
	- No order
	- Random orientation of atoms
	- Glass (SiO2)

Some materials (polymers) can have a combination of material domains

Silicon - diamond cubic structure (4 covalent bonds between atoms)

Silicon also has crystal planes (planes on which atoms lie), if you were to cut a crystal structure

Silicon crystals exhibit **anisotrophic behaviors** - behave differently from different directions

Silicon wafers come in different flavors - what type of doping (n or p type) or which crystal plane is planar to the surface of the wafer

Insulators have electrons all in their valence band - they are held tightly by the nucleus, cannot conduct
Semiconductors have electrons both in the conduction band, where electrons can move more freely and conduct
Metals have their valence and conduction band next to each other, so electrons can move freely between valence and conduction band.

The gap between the conduction and valence bands is known as the **energy gap**

Insulators - high energy gap, electrons can't get enough energy to jump to the conduction band at room temp

Semiconductors - lower energy gap, electrons can jump to conduction band at room temperature

Once electrons jump to the conduction band, it leaves behind a hole (positive ion charge), which can move as well

N-type doping - extra electrons near the conduction band
P-type doping - extra holes near the valence band

**Both make the semiconductor more conductive**


What happens in a PN junction? (where the P and N type silicon meets)?

The electrons will diffuse and the charges of the P and N type silicon will balance

This is called the depletion zone

Then, since the charges are concentrated, we can calculate the [[Electric Field]] and integrate it to get  the [[Electrical Potential]] (voltage)

**There is an electric potential when the two types of doped silicon meet, because of the depletion zone**

By applying voltage between the N and P silicon of the PN-junction, we can widen or shrink the depletion zone, increasing or decreasing the potential difference

In forward bias (P to positive voltage), the junction has a greater ability to conduct electricity

In reverse bias mode, the depletion region grows and the junction has a lesser ability to conduct electricity

This is a diode - electricity can flow only in one direction

NMOS transistor

If there is a voltage applied to the gate, the gate will be forward biased - then current can flow from the source to the drain. 

The current flow is linearly proportional to the gate bias, up to saturation
