  Based on the definition of the derivative, if the limit at a point on $f(x)$ does not exist, the derivative $f'(x)$ will not exist at that point

Jump discontinuity - the function is not defined at that point

Removable discontinuity - nothing to be tangent to

**If the function is not continuous at a point, it will not be differentiable at that point**

**If the function has a sharp corner at a point, it cannot have a tangent line at that point**

For piecewise functions: the tangent lines of both sides of the functions **must be equal** for the derivative to exist at that point


**If the function has a vertical tangent, it will not be differentiable at that point**

> For example, in $\sqrt[3]{x}$ at $x = 0$:

```desmos-graph
\sqrt[3]{x}
```

In summary, the derivative of a function will not exist at:
- Points of **discontinuity**
- Continuous points where the **derivatives from the left and right are not equal**
- Continuous points where the function has a **vertical tangent**

Continuity does not guarantee differentiability; however, differentiability implies and needs continuity
