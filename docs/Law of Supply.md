**Supply** is the willingness to sell a particular good or service

**Law of Supply**: Holding all things constant, there is a positive relationship between price and quantity supplied

$$
\text{Price} \uparrow \rightarrow \text{Supply} \uparrow
$$

The supply schedule/graph looks the same as that of demand, but is positively correlated (positive  slope)

**Factors to shift supply curve:**

- **P**rice of inputs
- **E**xpectations of suppliers (anticipation of profit)
- **S**ubsidies or taxes ([[Ten Principles of Economics|incentives]])
- **T**echnological changes
- **S**ellers (number of)
