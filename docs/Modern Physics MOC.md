What is the universe made of?

Atoms are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons, and those are made of quarks

Electrons shouldn't be thought of as particles, but as a vibration outside the nucleus instead.

Some laws (like Newton's second law) have shortcomings, and don't apply in all situations

Laws have limits

Even conservation of energy and momentum have shortcomings
