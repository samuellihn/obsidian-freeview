The **implicit function theorem** is used to differentiate functions defined implicitly in terms of $x, y$ and $z$

Rearrange the function such that $F(x, y, z) = 0$

From there, the implicit function theorem states that:

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = -
\frac{
\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}
}{
\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}
}
$$
> Notice how the same variables are arranged "diagonally" from each other

Similarly,

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = -
\frac{
\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}
}{
\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}
}
$$

This pattern can be used for any relation of $x, y,$ and $z$
