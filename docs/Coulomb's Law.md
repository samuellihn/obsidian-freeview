The larger the distance, the smaller the force, related by a inverse square factor. Putting this with the [[Fundemental Law of Charges]], we get Coulomb's Law:

$$
|\vec{F}| = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} * |\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}|
$$

> Force measured in newtons
> $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}$ is a constant, with $\epsilon_0$ being the **permitivity of free space**. Can also be written as $K = 9e^9$
> Distance is measured in meters
> Charges are measured in coulombs

Usually, Coulomb's law is used to measure the magnitude of forces, since attractive and repulsive force vectors have different directions depending on the object

Forces will be **identical for each particle**, but their signs will be opposite, exactly like [[Newton's Laws of Motion#Third Law of Motion|the Third law of Motion]]

# Three or more bodies

To solve attraction/repulision with more than one body, remember that electrostatic forces are vectors

Sometimes, you will get two answers. Use the one that makes sense based on the direction of forces.

# 2D  Space

Componentize the forces just as you would any other force, or use vector addition to find total magnitude

# Motion

If there is a net force, there will be a net acceleration. 
However, the force and thus the acceleration decreases as the particle moves away, because the distance increases

# Relation to Gravitational Force

Coulomb's law is very similar to the Law of Universal Gravitation, $-|\frac{Gmm}{r^2}|$. They both play a part on the atomic scale between protons and neutrons

Gravity dominates on **massive** masses, and is also always attractve (mass is always positive)

However, electrostatic forces dominate on a smaller scale, like holding molecules together
