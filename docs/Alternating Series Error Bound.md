If an alternating series converges by the [[Alternating Series Test]], the error from adding the first $n$ terms to approximate the value of the series will be **less than or equal to the first omitted term**

$$Error = |S- S_n| \leq |a_{n+1}|$$ 
> Error equals the partial sum minus the infinite sum ($|S - S_n|$)



> Example: if we add up 6 terms of the [[Harmonic Series and P-Series|Harmonic Series]], then we know our approximation is off by $\leq$ the absolute value of the 7th term

**Error is double-sided**:

$$S_n \pm |a_{n+1}| \rightarrow S_n + |a_{n+1}| \ (lower) \ or \ S_n - |a_{n+1}| \ (upper)$$
