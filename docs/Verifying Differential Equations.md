A differential equation can have an infinite number of solutions that satisfy it.
These solutions will be in the form of functions (the integral of the diferential equation)

To verify that a function is a solution to a differential equation, plug in the derivatives and functions as needed, cancel the like terms

Some questions will require solving for a constant

> When doing this, make sure to not write them as equal until it is completel verified!
