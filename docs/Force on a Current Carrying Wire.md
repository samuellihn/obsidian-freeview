There will be force on a wire carrying current though a magnetic field

$$
F = I\vec{l} \times B
$$

> This is because $I = \frac{dq}{dt}$, therefore $dq \frac{l}{dt} = qv$ 
> Treat the direction of the current as the direction of $v$

This is how DC motors work: magnetic field exerts force on a looped current carrying wire

Since one side is getting pushed up and one side being pushed down, the wire wil spin
The torque for one side will be:

$$
\tau = xI\vec{l} \times B
$$

Therefore the total torque will be:

$$
\tau_{total} = 2xI\vec{l} \times B
$$

> Note the $\sin{\theta}$ here: once the wire becomes vertical, there will be no torque as the force will not be perpendicular to the "lever arm" anymore


Most motors have more than one loop, because the more loops, the more torque
Total torque is:

$$
T_{total} = nIAB
$$
