A unit vector is a [[Vectors MOC|vector]] with a magnitude of 1

The three common unit vectors are $i$ and $j$ (in $R^2$ or 2D space) and $i, j, k$ in $R^3$ 

$$
i = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle
$$

$$
j = \langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle
$$

$$
k = \langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle
$$

For any vector $a$, $|a| = 1$ for the vector to be a unit vector

Therefore, to determine if a vector is a unit vector, test if:

$$
|a| = \sqrt{
a_1^2 + 
a_2^2 + 
a_3^2
} = 1
$$

If this holds true, the vector's magnitude is 1 and the vector is a unit vector

To create a unit vector, divide the vector by its own magnitude

$$
u = \frac{1}{|a|} \vec{a} = \frac{\vec{a}}{|a|}
$$

> This works because $|u| = |ca|$, meaning a vector's unit vector is simply a scalar multiple of itself. This scalar multiple is the vector's own magnitude.
