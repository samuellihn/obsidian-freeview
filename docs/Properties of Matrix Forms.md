Three properties of **echelon form**:
1. Nonzero rows above rows of zeroes
2. "Triangular" - leading entries are succisively to the right
3. Everything below a leading entry is zero

Two **additional** properties of **RREF**:
1. Leading entries are all 1
2. All zeroes above leading entries

When there is no more work to do in the matrix it is in RREF

Reduced Row Echelon Forms are **unique for each linear systems**
