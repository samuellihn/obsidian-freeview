**Fatigue** is progressive and localized damage due to **cyclic loading**

Example: A plane hull being pressurized and depressurized during takeoff and landing

Fatigue is measured **statistically**, and failure (after a certain point of fatigue) can occur **below yielding**

Some materials, if loaded below  a certain stress, will **never fail by fatigue**

> Since this is statistically this isn't a guarantee, but still nice to know

However, some materials will have their endurance limit approach zero (and will fail eventually, even under no load)
