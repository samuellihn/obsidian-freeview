**Deadweight loss** represents market activity that is **lost** under the implementation of an [[Excise Tax]]

**Nobody** in the market gets the revenue in the deadweight loss - does not contribute to tax revenue, consumers, or producers, sometimes considered a **social tax**

Represents:

- Buyers who would have bought at the pre-tax price ($P*$)but cannot afford to buy at post-tax price ($P_C$)
- Sellers who would have bought at pre-tax price ($P*$)but cannot afford to sell at post-tax price ($P_C$)

Deadweight loss depends on elasticity - take elasticity of demand as an example

If the demand is more elastic, consumers will "run away" from the market instead of paying the tax, leading to lost market activity (deadweight loss) - this does not happen as much when demand is inelastic

Extreme case - perfectly elastic and elastic demand

> Perfectly inelastic - no DWL (no lost market activity!)

**Deadweight loss increases at an increasing rate as tax increases**

> Deadweight loss is an area
> $$\int_{Q'}^{Q*} \frac{t}{2}dQ$$
> So as tax increases linearly, DWL increases at an increasing rate (quadratically)
