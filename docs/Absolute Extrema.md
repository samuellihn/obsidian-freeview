Absolute minima and maxima cannot be infinity, if it is infinity it simply does not exist

We need to take them on an interval, using our [[Critical Points]] to decide where to evaluate the functions to find the maxima

Absolute minima and maxima should be either an endpoint of the interval or a critical point.

They need to be expressed as **y-values** or ordered pairs!

Absolute max/min cannot exist at a point that does not exist

**The only eligible points to be absolute exrema are critical points and endpoints of an interval**
