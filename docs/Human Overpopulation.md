Human population is doubling every few decades

[[Exponential and Logistic Models|Exponential growth]] of 1.2 percent per year

Very, very rapidly increasing

Advances in technology, medicine, increased food supply/clothing/shelter, increased production => more humans can stay alive (and reproduce) at a given time

Consequences of more humans

- Destruction of other species' habitats
- Changes magnitude/frequency of earth processes
- increases impact of natural disasters
	- Increase rate of extinction of other species

Exceed **carrying capacity** of earth
