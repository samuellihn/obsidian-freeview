<p><strong>Economic Conservatives</strong> wanted a freer market and less government regulation to further promote economic growth</p>
<p><strong>Neoconservatives/traditionalists</strong> warned that abandoning traditional values was bad, new freedoms (counterculture, mass culture) and new concern with social issues conflicted directly with many conservatives' religious beliefs</p>
<p><strong>Anticommunist conservatives</strong> focused on the dangers of Soviet Union, did not agree with Ford/Nixon's detente policy, fought against SALT II (from Carter)</p>
<h1>"New Right" becomes popular</h1>
<p>19.1.2</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats were starting to become divided again now that the Cold War was less prevalent and the world wasn't going to blow up</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unification in 40s and 50s, separation in 60s and 70s (and onward)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Difference between political parties became more pronounced</p>
<p><strong>New Right</strong> - new conservative movement, grew rapidly, jointly by different types of conseravatives</p>
<p>Democratic party was also falling apart, as Johnson's policies on Vietnam divided the country</p>
<ul>
<li>Counterculture aliented souther denocrats and white conservative Chrsitians</li>
<li>Feminist movement was opposed by conservative Democrat social leaders</li>
<li>Oil crisis, hostage crisis weakened public trust in gov't (and Democrats)</li>
<li>Economy stagnated because of programs like Great Society, social programs lost appeal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Economic Conservatives</strong> believed liberal policies were respnosible for stagflation. Complained about heavy taxes, high gov't spending, <strong>unfunded mandates</strong> (programs required but not paid for by federal gov't)</p>
<p>Argued federal welfare programs rewarded lack of effort, made poverty worse, bad side effects, affirmative action contributed to reverse discrimination</p>
<p><strong>Sagebrush Rebels</strong> wanted fed gov't to give land in western states to the states for economic advantage, opposed by environmentalists because the federal lands were mostly preserved/undeveloped</p>
<p><strong>Religious right</strong> also supported new conservatives, worried about decline of traditioal family, opposed abortion, gay rights, and equal rights. Main group was <strong>Moral Majority</strong>, political organization working to fulfill Christian religious goals</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moral Majority touched Americans who normally didn't vote, registered 2m new voters in 1980, boosted Republican chances of winning</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Demographic Changes</h2>
<p>Many Americans moved to suburbs, taking away from the urban Democrat strongholds, also struggled financially so (expensive) liberalism was getting less popular</p>
<p>Migration from Rust Belt to Sunbelt helped Republicans, (racist) conservatives in Deep South now aligned with Republican views (party switch). Mostly white southerners, right after civil rights legislation was enacted</p>
<h1>Conservatives win</h1>
<p>19.1.3</p>
<p>Growing conservative movement allowed Ronald Reagan to win in 1980. Opposed big gov't, supported strong military, had faith in traditional values, was very optimistic</p>
<p>Formerly Hollywood movie actor, was not very famous (important in his consideration for optics during presidency)</p>
<p>Became Goldwater conservative, failed to make Goldwater win but brought the attention of many conservatives. Became California governor in 1966, won election in landslide in 1980 against Jimmy Carter</p>
<p>Election was close until presidential debate, where his communication gifts (incl. from his previous life) showed and he won 50.7% of popular vote and most electoral votes</p>
<p>Republicans also captured Senate, first time since 1955</p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"mdContent":"\u003cp\u003e1980 - back to conversation about economic systems\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eLiberals and Conservatives Diverge\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19.1.1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiberals favored government intervention to help the needy, where conservatives favored free market, private organizations, and individual goodwill to help the needy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat, conservatives clearly defined goals and values so they could win in the future\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoldwater returned to the Senate and found support from California Governor Ronald Reagan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReagan was elected president in 1980 and began a new conservative movement\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViewpoints:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n\u003cthead\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eLiberals\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003cth\u003eConservatives\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/thead\u003e\n\u003ctbody\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eGov't should play significant role to improve lives of all Americans\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eLarge gov't put economic growth in danger, stifled individual choice\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eValued social programs for poor, elderly, unemployed\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eFelt social programs left rising inflation and waste\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eLegislation to protect minorities, women\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eWanted to keep \"traditional values\"\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eGov't regulation of industry\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eReduce taxes and limit regulation to promote economic growth\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eCooperation with int'l organizations like UN\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003eStrong anti-communist stance, fighting using our own resources\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEconomic Conservatives\u003c/strong\u003e wanted a freer market and less government regulation to further promote economic growth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeoconservatives/traditionalists\u003c/strong\u003e warned that abandoning traditional values was bad, new freedoms (counterculture, mass culture) and new concern with social issues conflicted directly with many conservatives' religious beliefs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnticommunist conservatives\u003c/strong\u003e focused on the dangers of Soviet Union, did not agree with Ford/Nixon's detente policy, fought against SALT II (from Carter)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\"New Right\" becomes popular\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e19.1.2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepublicans and Democrats were starting to become divided again now that the Cold War was less prevalent and the world wasn't going to blow up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnification in 40s and 50s, separation in 60s and 70s (and onward)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifference between political parties became more pronounced\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Right\u003c/strong\u003e - new conservative movement, grew rapidly, jointly by different types of conseravatives\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemocratic party was also falling apart, as Johnson's policies on Vietnam divided the country\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCounterculture aliented souther denocrats and white conservative Chrsitians\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFeminist movement was opposed by conservative Democrat social leaders\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOil crisis, hostage crisis weakened public trust in gov't (and Democrats)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEconomy stagnated because of programs like Great Society, social programs lost appeal\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEconomic Conservatives\u003c/strong\u003e believed liberal policies were respnosible for stagflation.
