# Linearization
We can use tangent lines to reasonably estimate values of a function

If a line is below the curve, it is an **underestimate**
This means the slope of the curve is **increasing**

If a line is above the curve, it is an **overestimate**
This means the slope of the curve is **decreasing**

Do this by plugging in an x-value into an equation for a tangent line

When we know $x_1$ and $f(x_1)$:

$$f(x)\approx f'(x)(x-x_1)+f(x_1)$$

Or, on the $xy$ plane, 
$$y \approx y'(x-x_1)+y_1$$

> This is simply a rearrangement of the point-slope form of a given tangent line

The further away we get from the point where we found the line, the worse our estimate becomes
