Two types of control systems:
- Open loop control
	- Controller can't make adjustment based on the result
- Closed loop control
	- Output is monitored continuously and adjustments are made accordingly


Open loop controllers can't automatically adjust themselves - susceptible to overcontrol and undercontrol

> Car without a speedometer

Closed loop controllers have a feedback mechanism that acts as another input for the controller to monitor

> Air conditioner - monitors the room temperature to determine whether to turn on or off

**Open loop controllers aren't always bad - simpler, can be used in simple applications**
