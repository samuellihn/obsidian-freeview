Just like with functions in 2D, a function in 3D can have a tangent plane at any given point.

From there, a [[Linearization]] can be produced to estimate the value of a function around the point where the tangent plane is placed

The formula of the tangent plane for a function $f(x, y)$ at point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is as follows:

$$
L(x, y) = 
f_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) + 
f_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0) + z
$$

> Looks similar to the point-slope form used for tangent lines for functions in $R^2$, but with more terms

Sometimes, $f_x$ and $f_y$ need to be estimated from tabular data, see [[Estimating Derivaties]]
