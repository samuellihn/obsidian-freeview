For a given function $f(g(x))$, if we know a [[Taylor Series for Functions|Taylor series]] the outer function, which we call $f(u)$, we can substitute $g(x)$ into $u$ to get our new Taylor series for the respective function

For example, for the function $e^{x^2}$
$f(u) = e^u$, and $u = x^2$
Then, we can plug in $x^2$ whenever we'd put in $u$ in the original Taylor series, and simplify as needed to get our new Taylor series
