If 

- $d > 0$
- $d \vert m$ and $d \vert m$
- $\forall c \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, if $c \vert m$ and $c \vert m$, then $c \leq d$

Then  $d$ is the **greatest** common denominator of $m$ and $n$

> Also called greatest common divisor, or greatest common factor

If $m$ and $n$ are both $\neq 0$, there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that:

$$
mx + ny = gcd(m, n)
$$

You can speed up the process of finding these numbers by using information generated during the [[Euclidian Algorithm]], if you've found the GCD anyways
