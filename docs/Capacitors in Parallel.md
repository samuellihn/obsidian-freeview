In a parallel circuit, the voltage across all capacitors is the same:

Each capacitor forms a separate loop that [[Kirchoff's Loop Rule]] is applied to.

They are each **individually influenced** by the battery, so each can store as much charge as the battery's voltage allows it to

Therefore, the total charge stored is the **sum of all the charges**:

$$
Q_{total} = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + ...
$$

And since $Q = CV$, and all $V$ are the same so they cancel out (same battery, loop rule):

$$
C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + ...
$$

Reverse of [[Resistors in Parallel]] and inverse of [[Capacitors In Series]]

> As if all the parallel capcitors were [[Parallel Plate Capacitors]] and pushed together to form two large plates
