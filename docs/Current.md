The amount of charge that passes through a cross-sectional area of a wire in a given time

$$
I_{avg} = \frac{\Delta{Q}}{\Delta{t}} \ or \ I_{inst} = \frac{dq}{dt} 
$$

Can also be defined as $n$ (charge charges per volume) times cross-sectional area of conductor ($A$) times [[Drift Velocity]] $v_d$ times q (charge)

This will give the same unit as I

$$
I = nAv_d q
$$
