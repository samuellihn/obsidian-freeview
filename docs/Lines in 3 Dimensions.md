You can write a line as a [[Parametric Equation]] $y = 2x-2$ by observing the behavior of the line

$$(x(t), (y)t)$$
$$(-1 + 3t, -4 + 6t)$$
Smilarly, we can do the same in three dimensions, by analyzing two points:

$$(2, -5, 1) \rightarrow (-3, -1, 4)$$
$$
(2 - 5t, -5 + 4t, 1 + 3t)
$$
This way, we can clearly define a line in three dimensions wtihout needing to resort to arbitrary constraints

Called the **parametric form** of a linear of equation

If we solve for $t$ for all equations, we get the **symmetric form**:

$$\left\{ \frac{x-2}{-5} = \frac{y-5}{4}=\frac{z-1}{3}\right\}$$

# Relationships between lines

Two lines in $R^3$ are parallel when the **direction numbers** must be proportional

> If you think of the direction numbers as a vector representing the vector's change, these vectors must all be colinear/scalar multiples of each other

To find the intersection of lines, solve for $s$ and $t$ (the two parameters in the parametric form of two lines). They **must** agree at **all three points** for ONE given value of $s$ and $t$ for the line to intersect.

**Skew lines** are lines that are **not parallel** and **do not intersect**
