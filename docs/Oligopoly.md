- **Small number of sellers**
- **Significant barriers to entry** (though not impossible)
- **Less information**
- **Firms interacting strategically** - collusion and cartels

If producers in a market agree on what quantity and price to charge to effectively act as a monopoly, they agree to **collude** - the group of firms acting in unison is called a **cartel**

However, cartels are often unstable, and can be federally regulated and shut down - in this case, firms will make their own pricing decisions and approach a [[Nash Equilibrium]]

Although cooperation would maximize profits of the entire market, if firms act in their own self-interests, they **produce at a quantity greater than that of a monopoly with a price less than a monopoly**, but less quantity and greater price than a perfectly competitive firm

The competitive outcome ([[Nash Equilibrium]]) is the best for society as it maximizes surplus, and decreases the producer's profits
