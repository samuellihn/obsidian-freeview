**In the long run,** if a firm exits the market, the firm will not need to pay variable **or** total costs

A firm should exit if it is not making money **at all** - if total revenue is less than total cost

$$TR < TC \rightarrow \text{Exit}$$

On a per-unit basis (divide by $Q$)

$$P < ATC\rightarrow Exit$$
In this case, there would simply be no way for the firm to make money

The inverse of this is also true:

$$P > ATC \rightarrow Enter$$
