Also called *potential*, *potential difference*, *electrical potential*, or *difference*

Do not confuse with [[Electrical Potential Energy]]

Charged particles create [[Electric Field]]s. 

They also create a **potential field**, defined as the amount of Potential [[Energy]] per unit of charge a charged object would feel at that location

Scalar value: defines [[Electrical Potential Energy]] per unit of [[Electric Charge]]

Measured in volts: $\frac{Joules}{Coulomb}$A

$$V = k\frac{Q}{R}$$

Zero at infinity, just like [[Electric Field]] (always comparative)

To find the amount of work an electric field does moving a charge from one pont to another,

$$W_{field} = -q(V_f - V_0)$$
> $q$ is the charge of the particle being moved
> $V_o$ and $V_f$ are the voltages at the initial and final points
> **If the work is being done by an external force, remove the negative sign **

Positive charges accelerate towards lower potential, negative charges toward a higher potential

**[[Electric Field]]s always point towards lower potential, and equal potential lines are perpendicular to electric field lines**

Movement parallel to a potential requires work, but movement perpendicular (tangent?) to one requires no work as there is no change in potential

# Relation to [[Gravitational Field]]

A ball always wants to roll downhill to an area of lower gravitational potential energy

Likewise, positive charges always want to go to an area of lower electrical potential (lower voltage) and lower [[Electrical Potential Energy]]

However, negative charges want to go to an area of higher electrical potential but still wish to reduce their [[Electrical Potential Energy]] (energy is a scalar, all objects want to reduce/release their potential energy)

Electric field is like steepness

# Relation to [[Electric Field]]s

Electric fields are greatest when potential is changing the most drastically
> When the equipotential lines are closest together

Electric fields are vectors (they cancel out)
