Replacing animals with more powerful and faster cultivation methods

Machines ran on fuel, had a greater resource footprint

**Currently, agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels**

> 30% of carbon monoxide, 37% methane, 65% nitrous oxide emissions

Grew more crops, used more water/land to make more money

Polyculture (see [[Traditional Agriculture]]) shifted to monoculture, growing a single type of crop per field

> Reduces biodiversity, increases susceptibility to pests and diseases
> Narrows human diet

Depletes single type of nutrient in soil

Began to use fertilizers and pesticides to boost yields

**Tilling methods** - drastically increases erosion rates
