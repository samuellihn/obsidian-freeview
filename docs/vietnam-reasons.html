<p><strong>Indochina</strong>: Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos</p>
<p>Indochina was ruled by the French before WWII with an iron fist</p>
<ul>
<li>High taxes, harsh colonialism</li>
<li>Most people were impoverished and dissatisfied, leading to revolution</li>
<li>Some began to rebel against French exploitative rule</li>
</ul>
<p>Ho Chi MInh: anti French, eventually embraced communism to lead to a free Vietnam, was then embraced by the Soviets<br>
WWII drastically weakened French imperialism, therefore Minh could start his revolution</p>
<p>Truman sacrifices anti-communist beliefs and vows to fight communism and support French colonialism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also to make sure France stays an ally in the Cold War that's still going on</p>
</blockquote>
<p>US contributes 2.6b to France war efforts 1950-54</p>
<p><strong>Domino theory: If a country falls to communism, its neighbors fall to communism as well</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Vietnam were to fall to communism, Japan, Phillippines, and Australia might as well</p>
</blockquote>
<p>French surrender in 54 after 8 years, Vietnam divided into North (communist) ruled by Minh and South (anti-communist) supported by US</p>
<h1>17.1.5 US Response</h1>
<p>Truman initially only willing to supply money, not troops</p>
<p><strong>SouthEast Asia Treaty Organization</strong>: similar to NATO but to prevent communism in Southeast Asia (SEATO)</p>
<p>US provided aid to Ngo Dinh Diem, south Vietnam anticommunist leader</p>
<p>Lacked popular support from citizens: was a Catholic in primarily Bhuddist nation, but still supported by US because of his anticommunism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Signed anti-Bhuddist legislation, failed to enact significant land reforms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 1956 unification election, US predicted Diem would lose, so he didn't participate at all</p>
<p><strong>Vietcong</strong>: Communist rebel group in South Vietnam intending to undermine Diem's presidency. Practiced Guerilla warfare</p>
<p>Kennedy sends forces to assist and advise South Vietnamese soldiers</p>
<p>Diem's government continues weakening, so the US overthrows him and finds a new leader</p>
<p>Kennedy dies, diehard anti-communist Johnson comes into power</p>
<p>USS Maddox fired on by torpedo boats, a signal of Vietnamese aggression. Johnson orders airstrike against Vietnam</p>
<p><strong>Gulf of Tonkin Resolution:</strong> President can take any necessary action to defend American troops from vietnamese aggression</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Effectively gives the President power to use the military, bypassing Congressional allocation of right to declare war</p>
