Causes forces to be felt when an object comes close to another charged object

Radial around the charged particle

Similar to a gravitational field, but with one key difference: **electric fields can either be repulsive or attractive (pulilng towards or pushing away)**

The direction of the field is defined as the direction of the force a particle would experience if placed inside the field

Uses arrows radially pointed inward or outward from the force
- Points away from positive charges
- Towards negative charges

Electric field strength, measured in force per unit charge ($\frac{N}{C})$ at a point

$$\vec{E} = \frac{kq_{source}}{r^2} \hat{r}$$

> $\hat{r}$ is a unit vector that points from the source to the point being investigated
> $k$ is coulomb's constant, $9*10^9$
> As long as $q$ is positive, the electric field at that point will be the same direction as $\hat{r}$

However, the value from this equation will only be a magnitude. The vector must be written as a **sum of two x and y components**, in the form $\vec{E} = a \hat{x} + b \hat{y}$
Or, in the cosine and sine ratios, $magnitude * (\frac{adj}{|r|} \hat{x} + \frac{opp}{|r|} \hat{y})$ (avoids having to deal wtih angles)

# Field Lines

Electric field diagrams feature arrows pointing in the direction of electric fields (Field lines)

# Field Forces

**Forces and fields are different, but related!**
Electric forces, measured in Newtons, are calculated as such: 

$$\vec{F_E} = q \vec{E}$$
$$\vec{N} = C\vec{\frac{N}{C}}$$

Usually, these problems will involve [[Static Equilibrium#Equilibrium|static equilibrium]] states, which will involve zeroeing/cancelling vectors.
