<p>Edge: A feature connecting two vertices in a graph</p>
<p>Adjacency: When two vertices are directly connected by an edge</p>
<p>Incident edges: When two edges share a node</p>
<p>Loop: An edge with a single endpoint (same start and end)</p>
<p>Multiple/parallel edges: Two or more edges assigned the same set of endpoints</p>
<p>Simple graph: A graph with no loops or parallel edges</p>
<p>A drawing of a graph must satisfy 3 properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>An edge hits only one or two vertices (its endpoints)</li>
<li>A curve (edge) does not intersect itself (one-to-one), with the exception of loops</li>
<li>Two distinct edges intersect at finitely many points (can cross, but cannot be on top of each other)</li>
</ol>
<p>A subgraph is defined by a subset of the edges and a subset of the vertices in a graph</p>
<p>Walk: An alternating list of vertices and edges in a graph that represents a traversal between two points</p>
<p>Circuit: A walk that starts and ends at the same vertex</p>
<p>Trail: An walk with no repeated edges (Traversals across multiple edges don't count as repeats)</p>
<p>Path: A walk with no repeated vertices</p>
<p>Cycle: A circuit whose only duplicate point is the start/end point</p>
<p>Distance between two nodes: The length of the shortest walk between two nodes</p>
