General form of equation of a sphere:

$$
r^2 = (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2+(z-l)^2
$$

To find the projection of a sphere onto a plane, substitute the respective $x, y$, or $z$ to zero (for the three main planes) or an arbitrary number (for an offset plane) and the resultant equation will be the projected circle

Mention center and radius of projected circle, if exists (projection can also be a point)
