To find a modular inverse, find a number for which:

$$
a^-1 \times a \mod{m} \equiv 1
$$

For example, if we are in $\mod{27}$ if $a = 4$, then $a^{-1} = 7$ as $4 \times 7 = 28$, and $28 \mod{27} = 1$

Note that in a given modulus, not all numbers have an inverse

For example, in $\mod{4}$, $2$ does not have an inverse - there is no number for which $2 \times x \mod{4} = 1$
