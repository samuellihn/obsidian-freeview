Production vs. Labor:

> A to B: Total product increases at an increasing rate (ex: adding more workers improves utilization of factory)
> B to C: Total product increases, but at a decreaing rate (diminishing marginal returns)
> C to D: Total product decreases, at an increasing rate (diminishing marginal returns, ex: overcrowding)

Marginal Product vs. Labor:

> A to B: Adding more workers increases production (better utilizing equipment, allows for limited specialization)
> B to C: Adding more workers increases production, but at a diminishing rate workers need to wait, but still increases utilization
> C to D: Adding more workers **decreases** production at an increasing rate (overcrowding, etc.)

Total Cost Curve (cost vs. quantity of output)

Because of diminishing marginal returns, the total cost gets steeper and steeper when we try to increase output, as each worker costs the same but produces less product
