Energy be stored in various forms
It  be converted from one form to another
Is always conserved (Second law of Thermodynamics)

There are only three ways to add or remove energy to/from a system:

- Applying work 
- Applying heat
- Converting energy to mass ($E = mc^2$)

In a given system, all energy will cancel out: releasing energy also implies something else receiving energy

Three types of energy studied in AP Physics: [[Linear Kinetic Energy]], [[Gravitational Potential Energy]], [[Elastic Potential Energy]]

To solve conservation of energy problems:

$$KE_0 + GPE _0 + EPE _0 = KE_1 + GPE _1 + EPE _1 $$
- Zero out the parts that aren't in the problem
- Solve the equality using given figures
