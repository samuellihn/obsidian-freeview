A function that is continuous on an interval is continuous at each point in that interval

This means...
- There are no discontinuities on that interval
-   There are no holes, vertical asymptotes, jumps on the interval

Looking at **points** of discontinuity can help identify **intervals** of continuity

There are 6 types of functions that are continuous on all points in their domains:

| Function         | Domain                                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Polynomial       | All real numbers                                 |
| Rational         | Everything but vertical asymptotes               |
| Power (monomial) | All real numbers                                 |
| Exponential      | All real numbers                                 |
| Logarithmic      | > 0                                             |
| Trigonometric    | sin/cos ARN, tan everything but pi/2, 3pi/2, ... |


Some functions are not continuous **on their domains**
- Greatest/least integer (ceiling/floor) functions - jump discontinuities on every integer "step"
- Piecewise functions with jump discontinuities
