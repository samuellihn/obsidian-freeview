Test | If... | Conditions | Then... | Special Cases
----  | ----| ---- | ---- | ---
[[Geometric Series Test]] | Common ratio < 1 | Must be Geometric | Converges | Sum can be found:  $S_\infty = \frac{a_1}{1-r}$
[[nth Term Test for Divergence]]| $lim_{n \to \infty}{a_n} \neq 0$ | None, can be used on everything | Diverges | 
[[Integral test for Convergence]] | Positive, Continuous, Decreasing, for all $x > m$ where $m$ is an integer | As Stated and easily integratable | Series and [[Improper Integrals]] exhibits same behavior, but not same value | 
[[Harmonic Series and P-Series]]  P-series test for Convergence| $p < 1$ | Must be p-series | Converges | Note that $\sum{\frac{1}{n}}$ is divergent!
[[Direct Comparison Test]] | Terms of two series are **all** smaller or larger than terms of other series | Series must be positive, relationship must be true for all $a_n$ | If the smaller series diverges, so will the larger. If the larger series converges, so will the smaller | 
[[Limit Comparison Test]] | $lim_{n \to \infty}{\frac{a_n}{b_n}} = L$ where $L$ is finite, positive | Both series must be positive | Series will exhibit same behavior |  If $L = 0$, or $L = \infty$, the top term will exhibit the same behavior as bottom term
[[Alternating Series Test]] | Series is an [[Alternating Series]] | Absolute values of terms are decreasing and [[nth Term Test for Divergence]] equals zero | Series will converge
[[Ratio Test]] |  $\lim_{n \to \infty}{\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}} = L$ | Not a condition, but for series that don't fit into other tests | If $L < 1$, series converges. If $L > 1$, series diverges | If $L = 1$, test is inconclusive
