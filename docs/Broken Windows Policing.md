> In [criminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology "Criminology"), the **broken windows theory** states that visible signs of [crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime "Crime"), [anti-social behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behavior "Anti-social behavior") and [civil disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder "Civil disorder") create an [urban environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area "Urban area") that encourages further crime and disorder, including serious crimes.  The theory suggests that policing methods that target minor crimes such as [vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism "Vandalism"), [loitering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering "Loitering"), [public drinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_drinking "Public drinking"), [jaywalking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaywalking "Jaywalking"), and [fare evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fare_evasion "Fare evasion") help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness.
