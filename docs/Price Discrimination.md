**Price Discrimination** is when a firm sells the same good to different customers for different prices

Only possible in a monopolistic market, as the monopolist sets the price

Most clear when the buyers are in separate, non-interchangeable markets - they can charge different prices in these markets to capture more buyers

> Segger J-link - good example

Price discrimination is a rational decision to maximize profit, but depends on the ability to separate one market into two (**market segmentation**)

Can be defeated by [[Arbitrage]] or other market forces that defeat this

Price discrimination can eliminate the inefficiencies from [[Monopolistic Profit Maximization]], as more people can buy the book - people pay exactly how much they are willing to pay (so no consumer surplus) but the producer sells more (increasing producer surplus)

**Perfect Price Discrimination** - when a monopolist knows exactly what each customer is willing to pay, and charges each customer a different price - producer gets **all** the surplus in this case

In reality, perfect price discrimination is impossible, and monopolists try to segment the market based on demographics, etc. to **raise their profit**

**Whether (imperfect price discrimination can raise or lower a producer's surplus is indeterminate - but it is only done when it raises their profits** 

Examples - child and senior discounts, airline prices, discount coupons, financial aid, bulk discounts
