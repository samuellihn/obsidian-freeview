Graphical representation of a differential equation

For a given function $y' = F(x, y)$, 
A slope field graphs the slope of the function at each given point

Gives the general shape of a solution, which we can then create when given a specific point:

When plotting, create a chart with x and y as inputs, and $\frac{dy}{dx}$ as the output

> When our slope is undefined, for example at $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x}{y} \Bigg|_{ y = 0}$, **slope is vertical**\
> However, it can equal zero

Try to find a pattern (flip signs, etc)

Common patterns: 

Pattern | Function
-----| -----
Vertically the same  | No y
Horizontally the same | No x
Radially symmetric | $\frac{x}{y}$ or $x * y$
Horizontally symmetric | Even function
Vertically symmetric | $y^{even}$ or $|y|$

To confirm a function matches a slope field, find the differential (take the derivative) and verify against the slope field (not exact values, but whether it looks reasonable)



Make sure to confirm visually as well
