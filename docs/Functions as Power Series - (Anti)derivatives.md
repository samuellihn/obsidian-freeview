We can differentiate and integrate individual terms of a given series to create a new series

If we differentiate the terms of a series, our resulting new series will model the derivative of the function modeled by our original series

> If we integrate the [[Taylor Series for Functions|Taylor Series for]]  $\sin(x)$, we will get the series for $\cos(x)$

Remember that we are taking the derivative/integral with respect to x, so anything that doesn't rely on the value of x can be regarded as a constant
> Especially useful to avoid the [[Quotient Rule]]

Mostly will use the [[Power Rule]], since the factorials are usually constants with respect to x
