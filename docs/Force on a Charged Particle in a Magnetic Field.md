When a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it will feel a force
> The charged particle creates its own magnetic field, so the two fields interact

$$\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$$

> $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, in Teslas: $\frac{N}{C \frac{m}{s}}$
>  Note that this is the [[Cross Product]]

Or, if we only want the magnitude, 

$$|\vec{F}| = qV_{\perp_B} B \rightarrow |\vec{F}| = qVB \sin{\theta}$$

The cross product always gives a vector normal to the plane, so the direction of the force is straight up from the paper

> Remember the Right-hand Rule for cross products: When holding the right hand, if the middle finger pointed to the left is  $a$ and the pointer finger pointing straight is $b$, the cross product $a \times b$ will be in the direction of the thumb (straight up)
> **For a positive charge, use right hand**
> **For a negative charge, use left hand**

Be sure to consider the velocity of the particle after it has experienced the initial force
> Many of these scenarios end in [[Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion|UCM]] 
> Consider motion in three dimensions!



In this case, point the thumb in the direction of velocity and the palm in the direction of the force, pointer finger in the direction of the field

We can use the [[Kinematics of Uniform Circular Motion]] laws to figure out the radius of the circular path of a moving particle in a magnetic field

$$\frac{v^2}{r} = \frac{qv \times B}{m}$$

> Since velocity and electric field are usually perpendicular already, we can simplify to:
> $$\frac{v}{r} = \frac{qB}{m}$$

If the particle has a velocity component not parallel to the magnetic field, the particle may go in a helical pattern (UCM in two dimensions and constant velocity in the third)
