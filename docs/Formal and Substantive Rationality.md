"Legal" rationality

Subsumes action under **known rules and systematic methods** of arriving at answers

Focus on **present behavior**

> Markets (money), bureaucracy (structure) = about the means to a goal

# Substantive Rationality

Creates a particular distribution of goods, life chances, or other substantive ends

Oriented towards **ultimate consequences** 

> Ethical, political, utilitarian, egalitarian, etc. ends

**"Formally rational means lead to substantively irrational ends" ~Weber**
