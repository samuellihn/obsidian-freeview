 If our [[Taylor Polynomials]] has an infinite number if terms, then the series will eventually converge to its modeled function, as long as we're in the [[Convergence of Power Series|interval of convergence]]

> Taylor polynomial has a finite number of terms, Taylor series has infinite number of terms

Important Taylor-MacLaurin series:

$$
e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} +  \frac{x^2}{2!}... \frac{x^n}{n!}...
$$

$$
\sin{(x)} = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} ... \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}...
$$

> Note, only odd terms

$$
\cos{(x)} = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} ... \frac{(-1)^n x^{2n}}{(2n)!}...
$$

> Note, only even terms

Both sine and cosine start positive with the first (or zeroeth) term
Remember that for Taylor series, the summation ($n$) starts at 0

Remember that a series expressed in summation notation is just the terms added together, so we can add and subtract series which may cancel terms

We can also multiply series with other functions, using the distributive property to distribute something among all the terms of the series

> Note that we need to be careful when multiplying two infinite series together
