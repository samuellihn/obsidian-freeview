For a given convergent [[Geometric Series]], we can find function $f$ such that $f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}{a(r)^n}$


If our geometric series is convergent, then we can equate our function to the sum of all the terms:

$$S = \frac{a}{1-r}$$
> Useful if $r$ is equated to $x$


Usually will look something like:

$$f(x) = \frac{c}{1 - x}$$
Where $c$ is some constant

To turn a rational function in the form $\frac{c}{k - x}$ into a power series:
1. Ensure denominator starts with a 1
2. Denominator is in the form $1 - ...$
>  Note that $r$ can be negative, or a scalar multiple of $x$
>  Understand that this will also change the interval of convergence
3. Determine value of $a$ and $r$
4. Write power series as:

$$h(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty{a(r)^n}$$
