> For some people, coffee and tea are perfect substitutes, and any combination of either will make them equally happy

**Perfect complements**: goods **must** be consumed at a 1:1 ratio

> Left and right shoes: these must be consumed at an **exact** 1:1 ratio to be useful (if we have 1 left and 1000 right shoes, we will be equally happy as only one of each)
