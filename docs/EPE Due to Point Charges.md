To find the potential energy in a system of two point charges, 

	$$W_{Fe} = -\Delta{U_e} $$
	
	$$U_E = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r}$$

Very similar to the [[Energy of Gravitational Fields]] equation: simply [[Coulomb's Law]] multiplied by distance $r$

Opposite charges: potential energy will be negative (attraction)
Same charges: potential energy will be positive (repulsion)
 
Voltage between two parallel pllates: $Ed$
