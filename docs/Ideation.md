Ideation - to generate **lots of different** ideas

How do generate ideas?
- Break down the problem
- Look for solution to similar problems
- Talk to experts
- Sketch out the problem
- Brainstorm 
- Think - "how else could this be done?"

Brainstorming:

Focus on **one function** only, and write down/sketch **all** ideas

The goal of brainstorming is **quantity** - **quality comes later!** No criticism or judging

Start individually, encourage crazy ideas

**Beware of design fixation** - don't just focus on your first idea-
