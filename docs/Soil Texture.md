The texture of soil is determined by the size of particles

| Name | Texture | Particle Size             |
| ---- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| Clay | Sticky  | Small                     |
| Silt | Medium  | Medium                    |
| Sand | Loose   | Large                     |
| Loam | Medium  | All types, mixed of all 3 |

Qualities such as porosity, permeability, and fertility can be affected by particle size

Silty and loamy soil are ideal for plant growth (good mix between water holding and drainage)

In addition, particle size affects the ability of soils to hold water, and for water and air to enter the soil

Loose texture = gases can permeate into soil, less resistance for growing roots, water permeability

> Compacted soil is bad for plant growth as it does not have the three aforementioned properties
