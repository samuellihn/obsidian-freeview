The convergence of a [[Power Series]] will follow one of three cases:

**Case 1** converges only at the center (Only at one point)

$R = 0$

**Case 2** converges for x-values within a finite distance from the center

> Distance would be called the **Radius of Convergence** R

$R = k$, where $k$ is a real number

**Case 3** converges for all values of x

$R =\infty$

To find the radius of convergence, we can use the [[Ratio Test]] to see the interval of convergence

Start at a value that we **know** will converge, and make that the center of convergence

Then, apply the ratio test to "simplify" the series. It will then be simpler to see the relationship between x and when $n$ goes to infinity

> If the ratio is $<1$, the series will converge, find the values of x where it does

Once we find the interval of convergence, we need to take the **interval of convergence** (a compound inequality) and test the endpoints as well (by plugging the endpoints into $x$ of the original series)

> Check if the endpoints are inclusive or exclusive
