Two ways to express a set:

1. List notation: $S = \left\{1, 2,3, 4, 5\right\} \ \ T = \left\{-1, 0, 1\right\}$
2. Set builder notation $S = \left\{n:n \in \mathbb{Z}  \ and \ 1 \leq n \leq 5\right\}, T = \left\{x:x \in \mathbb{R} \ and \ x^3 = x\right\}$

Important sets of numbers:
- $\mathbb{N}$: Natural numbers (0... $\infty$) integers (counting numbers)
- $\mathbb{Z}$ All integers
- $\mathbb{Q}$ All rational numbers
- $\mathbb{R}$ All real numbers

They can be related as:

$$
\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}
$$

A **proper subset $\subset$ has less than what its ancestor has, while a regular subset $\subseteq$ can be equal to its ancestor

Special sets:
- $\mathbb{U}$ is the universal set
- $\emptyset$ is the empty set

When we denote a set like $|\mathbb{S}|$, we are denoting the **cardinality** of a set

The **cardinality** is the number of elements in $|\mathbb{S}|$

The cardinality of $\emptyset$ is still 1

The cardinality of $\mathbb{Z}$ is $\aleph$

Cardinality is not recursive
