A p-series is an infinite series of the form:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{n^P}} \rightarrow \frac{1}{1^P} + \frac{1}{2^P} + \frac{1}{3^P}...
$$

Where $p$ is a positive number
> If p was negative, the it would be infinity raised to a power, would never converge

The p-series:
- Converges if $p > 1$ 
- Diverges if $0 < p \leq 1$
> This method doesn't tell what the p-series **diverges to**

A p-series with $p = 1$ is called the **harmonic series**, and it diverges
