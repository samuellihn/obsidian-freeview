The five variables used in kinematics are:

Variable | Quantity
---|---
$a$ | acceleration
$x$ | position
$v$ or $v_f$ | final velocity
$v_0$ | initial velocity
$t$ | time

There are five kinematics equations that can be used when one variable is missing:

Equation | | Missing Variable | | 
---|---|---|---
$v = v_0 + at$ | [[Kinematics Equations#First kinematics equation]] | Position | $x$
$x = x_0 + v_0t + at^2$ | [[Kinematics Equations#Second Kinematics Equation]] | Final velocity | $v_f$
$x = x_0 + v_ft - at^2$ | Variation of  [[Kinematics Equations#Second Kinematics Equation]] | Initial velocity | $v_0$
$\bar{v} = \frac{v_i + v_f}{2}$ | [[Kinematics Equations#Average Velocity Equation]] | Acceleration | $a$
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a(\Delta{x}) | [[Kinematics Equations#Third Kinematics Equation]] | Time | $t$
Choose the correct kinematics equation based on what to solve for, and what key variable is missing
