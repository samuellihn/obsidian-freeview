A junction is an **intersection in a circuit**, where a circuit can go one of multiple paths

Therefore, the Junction Rule states that:

> The sum of all the currents going into the junction **must equal** the sum of all the currents going out of the junction

$$
\sum{I_{in}} = \sum{I_{out}}
$$

Relates to the [[Conservtion of Charge]]

If we call any point on the circuit a junction, this rule states that within a straight wire, current does not change
> Current cannot appear or disappear

Used to solve for the current going through a path
