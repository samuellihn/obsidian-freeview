The direction angles of a vector $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$  are the angles a vector makes with the $x$, $y$, or $z$ axes, respectively

> Since $i, j, k$ [[Unit Vectors]] are each colinear with the $x, y, z$ axes, we can use these to determine the direction angles using [[Dot Product]]s

$$a \cdot i  = |a| \cos\alpha = |a||i| \cos\alpha$$

> Because $|i| = 1$

Therefore, 

$$\cos\alpha = \frac{a \cdot i}{|a|}$$
This is the same case for all the other direction angles $\beta$ and $\gamma$ ,using the dot products with unit vectors $j$ and $k$:

$$\cos\beta = \frac{a \cdot j}{|a|}$$
$$\cos\gamma = \frac{a \cdot k}{|a|}$$
