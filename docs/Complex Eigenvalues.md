Some matrices have no real eigenvalues, as some matrices never leave vectors along their own spans - an example is a rotation

A matrix can also have complex [[Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues]]

This occurs when the [[Characteristic Equation]] of the matrix has imaginary roots (if it is a polynomial of degree $n$, then the polynomial will always have $n$ real + imaginary roots)

Complex eigenvalues always come in conjugate pairs (when the matrix $A$ is a real matrix), of the form $a + bi$ and $a - bi$

> These conjugate forms are denoted $x$ and $\bar{x}$

> The quadratic formula is useful for finding complex eigenvalues of a $2 \times 2$ matrix

These eigenvectors act on the complex space $C^n$
