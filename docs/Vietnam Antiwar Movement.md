# Antiwar Sentiment Grows

17.3.1

More troops were being sent, more soldiers died

Divided Americans more deeply than any conflict since the Civil War

By 1965, most men being sent were draftees (>1.5 million drafted)

## Against Draft

Draft was unfair: granted deferments to college students, certain occupations, and rich people

> Most drafted were poor, working class
> African Americans also very high, deaths were disproportionately high and were given menial tasks

MLK Jr. spoke out against war burden to African Americans and poor people

> Able to fight and die together but not able to go to the same schools

TL;DR: Inequalities in draft led to widespread resistance to it

> Some burned draft cards
> Stop the Draft Week: October 1967

## On College Campuses

College campuses became a major protest ground against the war

Many more students enrolled in college, college students became their own individual class

26th Amendment: "old enough to fight, old enough to vote" allowed 18 to 20-year-olds to fight

## In Media

Antiwar sentiment the result of media's coverage, many Americans had TV sets and could closely watch progress of the war

> First "Living Room War"

Brutal reality of war broadcast into American homes, messy conflict with no objective or progress

**Credibility Gap**; between what Johnson administration said and what journalists/tv said about it, grew distrust of US government's statements

# Tet Offensive

17.3.2

General Westmoreland said that Vietcong were defining in strength, could no longer mount a major offensive. **He was wrong.**
1968

Tet Offensive: coordinated assault on provincial capitals and major cities in South Vietnam, and also the **US Embassy in Saigon**

Planned to hold cities until US gave up and war ended

US and South Vietnam were able to fight off the offensive, but still showed the world that the Vietcong was not weakening

American leaders were less confident of a quick end to the war

US SoD thought war was "bottomless pit"

**Turning point of war**, suggesting that US should pursue peace instead of victory

Because of this failure, Johnson did not seek recollection as war was undermining his presidency

Eugene McCarthy (Democratic antiwar candidate), Robert Kennedy also campaigned

**Johnson announced that US would limit bombing of N. Vietnam and seek negotiated sentiment, and also announced he would not run for president**

# 1968 Election

17.3.3

Robert Kennedy assassinated, he cannot run for president anymore

Democrats nominated Hubert Humphry, just as Chicago antiwar protestors fought outside the convention—Democrats were weakened significantly as the event was televised

Republicans nominated Richard Nixon under the platform of "peace with honor", getting the US out of the war on honorable peace terms

Promised to listen to non-protesting “silent majority” and convinced more Southern voters as they appealed to law and order

George Wallace also ran, desired to press forward to victory in Vietnam, overall racist

Third-party by Wallace and Nixon's undermining of traditional Southern Democrat support siphoned Democrat votes away from Humphrey
