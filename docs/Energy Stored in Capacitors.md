The more electrons are pushed into a plate in a capacitor, the harder it is to put more electrons as the ones already on the plate will repel the new ones

For each small amount of charge put into the plate, the energy is:

$$
dU = vdq
$$

So the total amount of energy is:

$$
U = \int{vdq}
$$

And since $$
And since  C = \frac{Q}{V} \rightarrow V = \frac{Q}{C}
And since $$

$$
U = \frac{1}{C} \int_0^Q{q\ dq} \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}q^2 \Bigg|^Q_0 \rightarrow \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{C}Q^2  \ or \  \frac{1}{2}CV^2 \ or \ \frac{1}{2}QV
$$

> $\frac{1}{2}CV^2$ and $\frac{1}{2}QV$ is derived from $Q= CV$ and $C = \frac{Q}{V}$
 
> A smaller capacitor will have larger energy with the same charge than a larger capacitor (Electrons more densely packed, more energy)
