# Economic Liberalism

The Wealth of Nations - Adam Smith

Reaction to mercantilism - the idea that wealth is finite

People should keep as much as they can, suppress imports and encourage exports

"Outsiders are enemies"

Smith - freedom to produce, trade, and work in one's own interest (the division of labor)
