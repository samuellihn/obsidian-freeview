To primary 'veins' of sociology research:

**Qualitative research**

* Observations
* Interviews
- Immersion

**Quantitative research**

* Structured surveys
* Statics
* Internet


However, this is false dichotomy - both can, and should, and are usually used:

**Mixed methods**: Both qualitative and quantitative methods to understand a situation
# Methods:

Ethnographic immersion:  Put yourself in a situation and get deep into it

# Important distinctions

Participant and non-participant observation: are you a member of what you are studying?

Inductive vs. deductive theory development

# What constitutes valid knowledge?

See [[Epistimology]]

**Generalizability depends on sample size**
lower generalizability - small sample
higher generalizability - large sample
