# Equilibrium prices

Columns must add to zero, rows do not need to add to zero

This is because the coefficients for a particular $pm$ need to add to zero

# Balancing Chemical Equations

Write all the elements involved into a vector. For each molecule, put the number of atoms per molecule into the corresponding vector entry.

$$
\left[
\begin{matrix}
C\\O\\N
\end{matrix}
\right]
$$

Use these as the columns of the matrix, negating the weights on the results side of the equation and augmenting with the zero vector

Solve for the weights, which correspond to the coefficients of the molecules in the chemical equation
