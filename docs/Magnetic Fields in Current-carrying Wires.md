[[Electric Field]]s are caused by positive and negative charges

**The source of magnetic fields is moving charges**

> Since motion is relative, so are magnetic fields

Current flowing through a wire will create a circular magnetic field around the wire

The direction of the magnetic field should go counterclockwise if looking from the "rear" of the current

> If the thumb if your right hand is pointed toward the current flow, the direction of the magnetic field can be determined by gripping the wire
> Also determined by the right-hand rule

Same thing is observed for a singular moving charge: magnetic field will be a cylinder around it

> However, for a point charge, the magnetic field will also fade when we get further away from the charge, even in the axis the charge is moving

**The magnetic field directly on the particle's action of travel is zero**
