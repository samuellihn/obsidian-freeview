Work is defined as the exertion of force over a displaceent

$$W = F * d_{parallel}$$

> **Dot product** of force and distance
> $$W = F \cdot d$$
> The displacement and force need to be in the same direction (incl. decomposed components)

> Although [[Energy]] is unsigned, work is a vector and should be added as such when calculating net work

Work is done in the context of a [[Systems|system]]
Work requires [[Energy]]
> Units of work: $J = N \cdot m$

For vertical movement $W = mg * \Delta  y$
