If function $f$ is positive, continuous, and decreasing for $x \geq m$ where $m$ is a positive integer $\geq 1$, and $a_n = f(x)$, then:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {a_n} \ and \ \int_1^\infty{f(x)}dx
$$ Will **both** either converge or diverge

Function $f(x)$ needs to be:
- Positive
- Continuous
- Decreasing
For all $x \geq m$

**Make sure to connect back the behavior of the improper integral to the behavior of the series!**

> **The series will not always converge to the same value the improper integral converges to!**
