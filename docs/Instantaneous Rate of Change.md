How do we find average rate of change?
The slope between two endpoints of a function

What it is an instant?

> An infinitely small amount of time at $\Delta{t} = 0$

Now do we find the average velocity if $\Delta{t} = 0$ and $\Delta{f(t)} = 0$? 

Make $\Delta{t}$ smaller and smaller and find the **limit**

The formula for average rate of change is:

$$
\frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta{f(t)}}{\Delta{t}} = \frac{\Delta{f(t + h) - f(t)}}{h}
$$

The formula for instantaneous rate of change is therefore:

$$
\lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{\Delta{f(t + h) - f(t)}}{h}}
$$

> The instantaneous rate of change can only be approximated by finding the average rate of change over increasingly smaller intervals
