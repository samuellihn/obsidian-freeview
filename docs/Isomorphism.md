Two drawings of a graph are said to be isomorphic if the vertices of one graph can be mapped to another

Using arrows to map the vertices ($1 \rightarrow a$) if $1$ is a vertex and $a$ is a vertex

For example, graphs $C_4$ and $K_{2, 2}$ are isomorphic

Isomorphism is represented by the congruence symbol ($\cong$)

An **automorphism** is a graph that is isomorphic to itself

> There are $n!$ automorphisms for complete graph $K_n$

Any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex and still come up with the same graph is **vertex transitive** 

$$
\forall (u, v) \in V, f(u) = v
$$
