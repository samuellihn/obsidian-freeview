What happens when a ball is launched/thrown horizontally in the air?

Break it into two components

Vertical component: free fall (gravitational force acting on the ball)

> Initial component is the vertical velocity of the ball

**Horizontal component is constant velocity until it hits the ground**


Time is the **constant link** between the two dimensions

> Evaluate the vertical travel first, then the horizontal travel
> Use the time calculated from the vertical travel
