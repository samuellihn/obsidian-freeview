{"pageProps":{"mdContent":"<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>With the increasing importance of digital message passing in communications applications, it is crucial to verify the integrity of digital messages to ensure complete and correct data transmission. Error checking algorithms aim to address this issue by detecting when a given message is incomplete or has been altered in transmission. This paper will present the cyclic redundancy check, a popular error-checking algorithm.</p>\n<h2>A Brief History</h2>\n<p>The most primitive form of error checking involves a parity bit, a single bit appended at the end of the message. This bit is assigned either a 1 or 0 value depending on the contents of the message to make the total number of 1s even (in the case of even parity) or odd (odd parity). Examples of even parity are shown below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://networkencyclopedia.com/cyclic-redundancy-check-crc/\">https://networkencyclopedia.com/cyclic-redundancy-check-crc/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scheideler/courses/600.344_S02/CRC.html\">https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scheideler/courses/600.344_S02/CRC.html</a><br>\n\"Hacker's Delight\"</p>","pageTitle":"Cyclic Redundancy Checks"},"__N_SSG":true}
