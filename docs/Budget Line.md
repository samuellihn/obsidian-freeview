The **budget line** represents different combination of goods that a consumer can buy given a fixed income

Always linear, linear combination of goods

For a fixed income $I$:

$$I = Q_xP_x + Q_yP_y$$

The budget line can shift/rotate: if the price of good Y increases, the consumer will be able to buy less, so that point will shift inward (and budget line becomes steeper)

**Income Effect**: Budget curve goes outward, the consumer is **entirely** richer, we can buy more of **both** goods
