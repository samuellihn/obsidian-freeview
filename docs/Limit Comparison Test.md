Like the [[Squeeze Theorem]] that we are "squeezing" on the x-axis

With the [[Direct Comparison Test]], it is sometimes difficult to verify the relationship between all the terms in the series

If $a_n > 0$ and $b_n > 0$ (series only consist of positive numbers), and 

$$\lim_{n\to \infty}{\frac{a_n}{b_n}} = L$$

where L is finite and positive, the two series will either **both** converge or diverge

> Don't perform the test on an alternating series
> **Doesn't matter** which of the two series is the numerator/denominator

Will need some algebraic manipulation to determine similar series and to place them on top of each other, do not forget [[Complex Fraction Rules]]


If $L = 0$, or $L = \infty$, the top term will exhibit the same behavior as bottom term
