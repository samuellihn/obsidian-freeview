# Ferguson to Baltimore

Policies were created to quarantine Black people to reduce civil disturbance, precent spread of communicable disease to nearby White neighborhoods, and protect property values among the White majority

Quarantine Baltimore's black population in isolated slums

Protests are not about policing - core of issue is not about segregation

"Racial ghetto" - a destructive environment unknown to most white Americans

Not a vague white society that created ghettos but explicit government racial laws, policies and regulations to ensure Black poverty and subsequent segregation from whites

1910 segregation rule - found unconstitutional because they infringed on rights of white homeowners to sell to whoever they wanted

Instead, inspectors issued code violations to anyone who rented/sold to blacks in predominantly white neighborhoods

Restrictive covenants to commit owners never to sell ot an African American - could be enforced by evicting a Black family that purchased the policy

Federal Housing Authority - refused mortgages to black families in white neighborhoods, and also in black families ("redlining")

> Neighborhoods were considered poor credit risks because Black poeple were living in or near them

Black families had to buy homes on contract sales, which were sales that did not build equity, meaning missed payments would lead to loss of a home

Multiple families would live in one home, overcrowding schools, white people would leave, but black people could not leave because they were on contract sales

> Difficult for Black families to accrue wealth, Black wealth is only at 5% of White wealth despite having 60% of income

Housing and Urban Development secretary George Romney proposed to deny federal funds to suburbs that resisted integration; was shot down

Identified that solving urban Black ghettos was not about pouring money into them, but providing suburban housing to Black families and alloiwng land, money, and jobs from urban areas to propagate to Black people

Practice still continues - black people are still marketed subprime loans with high interest rates and prepayment penalties, and people go to black churches to market these

Baltmore has experienced a century of public policy to segregate and impoverish its Black population

With no suburbanization on the agenda, these conditions will continue to exist

"Lead kid" - childhood home had lead paint, lead poisoned and cognitive ability impaired

Lead-paint settlements ("structured settlements") granted monthly checks with increases over a number of years

Access Funding - bought the monthly settlement valued at over $338k (664k total) for under 63k

Structured settlements - deliver monthly payments to protect vulnerable recipients from spending a lump sum immediately

Companies purchase rights to structured settlements for less than thier face value

To industry, people who need money immediately get it immediately by setlling their settlement

Profits off poor and disabled people that cannot understand the value of thier settlement

Reflects story of Freddie Gray, another lead-poisoned person that had difficulty with learning, and sold settlement to Access Funding

Lead poisoned people are especialy fulnerable as they are impulsive and mentally disabled, but not under the law - cannot read, do math, etc. but cannot have a trustee manage their property

3/4 of Access Funding's structured settlement purchases involved lead-poisoned victims, paying about 33 cents on teh dolar for the settlement

Freddie Gray sold 146k of his structured settlement for 18.3k to put him out of debt, and his siblings did the same

People in these neighborhoods cannot escape lead paint, as every house in these neighborhoods has lead paint

Poverty is expensive, and Maryland's law makes it easier to sell the settlements (can file petition outside county, doesn't require seller to appear in court) so firms can find county judges that approve the deal

Very easy to find lead-paint victims, as their cases are filed publicly
