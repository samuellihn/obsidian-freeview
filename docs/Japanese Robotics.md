1980s - booming automotive and electronics industry drove Japan's economic growth

Notion that robots were a toy for children - automation was for real engineers

Industrial machines that automated manufacturing attracted government and industrial sponsorship

After WWII, Japan could pay reparations in "technical aid" instead of with money

High postwar birth rate was an anomaly, and labor force and population would shrink

**"Information Society"** - path toward new economic world would rest on rise of information technology

> Manufacturing would solve labor decline, computer technologies would run social services

To market these technologies - appealed to consumer base by making things "personal"

People began to look for meaning beyond work, and a sense of purpose - "my car", Walkman, etc. - created emotional appeal to Information Society

Japanese industry and government insisted that technology could fix social problems

Technology would bring prosperity to all, create prosperous, classless society to eliminate need for welfare system

Corporate world would regulate economy and society and shrink government

**Growing Japanese economy increased demand for service, fewer people wanted to go into service sector**

> Japanese service = hospitality, warmness

Traditional Japanese household - grandparents, parents, and children - wife had to take care of both sets of elderly grandparents on top of childcare

"Robot" - went through phase of automation, humanoid shape, human-friendliness

Robots were no longer solely for automation and manufacturing - engaged personally with the consumer

Would also free the government from need to provide welfare - consumer robotics would take care of it all

"My robot" - a personal robot that would provide company, do housework, etc. - targeted housewives especially, who had to do this work

"Information work" - provides not only the practical side of services, but the hospitable and cheerful part as well

"Affective engineering" - making robots personable, and appeal warm and organic to humans - cuteness

> Funding corporate research on what made robots personable was an attempt to offset the need to invest in welfare or to develop services that would replace labor previously provided by women. (29)

> Unfulfilled emotional needs meant that there was a market demand for a product that promised to fulfill these needs.

Personability was a pathway to profit - the commodification of emotional labor

desire for robotic companionship is a cry for help - someone to show that they care - mental distress of overworked Japanese citizens

Avoid solving pressing social problems and increase profits for corporations
