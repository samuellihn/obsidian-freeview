We can take the derivative of derivatives. These are called **higher order derivatives**

Function | Newton Notation | Liebniz Notation
---|---|---
1st derivative | $f'(x)$ | $\frac{dy}{dx}$
2nd derivative | $f''(x)$ | $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$
3rd derivative | $f'''(x)$ | $\frac{d^3y}{dx^2}$
nth derivative | $f^{(n)}(x)$ | $\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}$

Each subsequent derivative may require different rules

The second derivative of a function in Liebniz notation is originally written as:

$$
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{d\Big[\frac{dy}{dx}\Big]}{dx}
$$
