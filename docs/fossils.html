<blockquote>
<p>Remnants become petrified, become part of sedimentary rock</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fossils are old as the rock, as they are formed together</p>
<p>Two ways to determine fossil age:</p>
<p><strong>Relative Age - how deep the fossil is in the ground gives a rough estimate of age</strong></p>
<p>Older fossils are deeper in the ground, and fossils at approximately the same depth (in a given area) are likely around the same age</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Law of Superposition</strong> - layers/<strong>strata</strong> of Earth's crust increase in age as depth increaase</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Absolute age - use absolute dating based off of radioactive isotopes</strong></p>
<p>Uses the <a href="half-life">Half-Life</a> of a radioactive isotope found in the organism to determine how long it has been since the organism died</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparison of how much stable vs. how much radioactive chemicals are in the organisms,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Old fossils have very little radioactive isotopes, as most of it has decayed into stable elements</p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"mdContent":"\u003cp\u003eFossils are formed when organisms are buried in sediment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemnants become petrified, become part of sedimentary rock\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fossils are old as the rock, as they are formed together\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo ways to determine fossil age:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelative Age - how deep the fossil is in the ground gives a rough estimate of age\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlder fossils are deeper in the ground, and fossils at approximately the same depth (in a given area) are likely around the same age\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLaw of Superposition\u003c/strong\u003e - layers/\u003cstrong\u003estrata\u003c/strong\u003e of Earth's crust increase in age as depth increaase\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbsolute age - use absolute dating based off of radioactive isotopes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUses the \u003ca href=\"half-life\"\u003eHalf-Life\u003c/a\u003e of a radioactive isotope found in the organism to determine how long it has been since the organism died\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComparison of how much stable vs. how much radioactive chemicals are in the organisms,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld fossils have very little radioactive isotopes, as most of it has decayed into stable elements\u003c/p\u003e","pageTitle":"Fossils"},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/[...note]","query":{"note":["fossils"]},"buildId":"Jra0ICHvocxot762ilzgJ","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
