How much the demand of one good changes when there is a change in the price of other goods

If $E_{XY} > 0$, good X and good Y are **substitutes**

> A rise in price for one good will increase demand for the other

If $E_{XY} < 0$, good X and good Y are **complements**

> A rise in price in one good will decrease demand for the other

If $E_{XY} = 0$, they are completely unrelated

> Changes in price for one good has **zero effect** on the other

$$E_XY = \frac{\% \Delta Q_A}{\% \Delta P_B}$$
