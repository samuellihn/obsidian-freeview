**Design** - the process of developing a satisfactory idea to solve a specific problem

> Developing - evaluating, iterating, refining
> idea- thinking, creativity, imagination
> specific - design requirements

Design is **not** trial and error

```mermaid

	D["Prototyping"]-->E
	E["Testing"]-->F["Evaluation"]
	B-->A
	C-->A
	D-->A
	E-->A
	F-->A
```


Changes should come either **iteratively** or **early**
