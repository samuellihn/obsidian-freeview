To differentiate composite functions, replace the inner function $g(x)$ with $u$

Then, find the derivative of u ($du$) in terms of $dx$. Solve for $dx$, then replace $dx$ with what you solved for ($du$ times a constant term)

From there, we can change the variable of integration:

$$
\int{f(u)(k)du}
$$

We're replacing the variables of integration and the function just like variables!

Then, apply the [[Integration Rules]] with respect to $u$

And replace the $u$ and $du$ in the final answer
