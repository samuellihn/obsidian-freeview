Reduces ecosystem services, and impairs functioning of ecosystem

Topsoil takes a long time to generate - 1 inch of topsoil can take hundreds of years

US croplands lose 1 inch of topsoil every 15-30 years

# Land degradation

Deterioration fo land, diminishes productivity and biodiversity

Caused by:
- Unsustainable/intensive agriculture
- Erosion
- Deforestation
- Urban sprawl
- Urbanization

Leads to:
- Soil nutrient depletion
- Increased erosion
- Changes in soil structure, pH
- Waterlogging
- Loss of organic matter from soilA
- Chemical pollution
- Salinization of land
- Reduced levels of potable water
- Biodiversity loss

# Soil Degradation

Deterioration of soil quality, which causes a productivity decrease for the land

Caused by:
- Forest removal
- Cropland agriculture
- Livestock overgrazing

Leads to:
- Reduced food production/productivity potential

# Erosion

Happens quicker than soil is formed
Removes topsoil which causes major issues for agriculture

Abiotic causes:
- Steep slopes
- High precipitation
- Flowing water

Anthropogenic causes:
- Farming - field overcultivation, excessive tilling, high-input agricultural practices, poor crop planning (loosens soil, no roots to hold in place)
- Rangelands - overgrazing, livestock population above carrying capacity
- Forestry - clear cutting forests

## Prevention Methods

Barriers can be constructed to capture soil and allow it to deposit close to where it is eroded from

Different agriculture techniques that reduce loosening the soil such that it is eroded

Plant vegetation (cover crops) for roots that hold soil and absorb water

> However, risk of introducing invasive/non-native species is high for fast-growing cover crops
