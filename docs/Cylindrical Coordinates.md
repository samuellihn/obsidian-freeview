A cylindrical coordinate system is a [[Polar Equation|Polar Coordinate System]] projected straight upwards into the z-dimension

$$P(r, \theta, z)$$

The zero angle starts at $+x$ (rotation starts at $+x = \theta = 0$)

To convert to rectangular coordinates:
$$x =  r \cos{\theta}$$
$$y = r \sin{\theta}$$
$$z = z$$
