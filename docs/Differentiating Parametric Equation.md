For a [[Smooth Curve]] $C$ represented by a pair of [[Parametric Equation]], the slope of the tangent line to $C$ (the [[Derivatives MOC|derivative]]) is:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
$$

> Note that $\frac{dx}{dt}$ must not be zero!
> In order for our derivative to be in terms of $x$ we are dividing the two derivatives so the $dt$ will cancel

We are taking two derivatives, one for each function $x(t)$ and $y(t)$, and then dividing them by each other

Make sure to put $\frac{dy}{dt}$ on top

The derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ will still be in terms of $t$, because this is the slope of the tangent line at a **point** with a particular value of $t$

If we need to find an equation, plug in $t$ into $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ and create a [[Point-slope Form]] equation

If $\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$, then the tangent line will be vertical

If $\frac{dy}{dt} = 0$ or $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$, the tangent line will be horizontal

> If a problem asks for **points**, make sure to plug the values of $t$ back into $x(t)$ and $y(t)$

If **both** $\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}$ are **simultaneously** zero at a given $t$, then there will be **neither** a horizontal or vertical tangent line
