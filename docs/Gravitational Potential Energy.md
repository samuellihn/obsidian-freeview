The **gravitational potential energy** of a mass increases by $mg\Delta y$ when it is raised by displacement

Changes in an object's height will **always** result in a change in gravitational potential energy
$\Delta GPE$ is important (always relative), not the actual value of $GPE$
$GPE$ is defined as the negative of the [[Work]] done by an attractive field
$$GPE = -W_{grav} =mgh$$
