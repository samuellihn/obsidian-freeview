Egypt had opposed Israel's existence since 1948, war up until 1973. By 1977 both countries tried to improve relations

Carter invited the Egyptian President and Israeli Prime Minister to Camp David and they produced the Camp David Accords

- Egypt formally recognized the nation of Israel
- Israel withdrew troops from Sinai Peninsula, which it had controlled since 1967 as result of a war

Carter hoped that Camp David Accords would make the Middle East at peace and cooperate

In Iran, U. S. had supported the Iranian Shah (emperor) because it was anticommunist, but very unpopular and repressive to the people. The Shah fled Iran and the U. S. allowed him to enter for medical treatment for Cancer

Meanwhile fundamentalist Islamic clerics took power led by Ayatollah Khomeini

Many Iranian radical students invaded U. S. embassy as a result, took 66 Americans as hostages, Khomeini took control of embassy and hostages

Carter failed to release the hostages, showed American weakness and that Carter's foreign policy was weak

Also showed that Middle Eastern conflicts also posed a very large threat to the United States, even more so than the Soviets
