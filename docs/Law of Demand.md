**Demand** is the ability and willingness of customers to purchase and pay for goods and services

The **demand schedule** is a table of demand at each price point

Example: market for laptops

| Price | Demand Quantity (number of buyers) |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| $200  | 20                                 |
| $300  | 15                                 |
| $400  | 10                                 |
| $500  | 5                                  |
| $600  | 2                                  |

The **law of demand** states that there is an **inverse relationship** between price and demand (given one particular good and no external factors)

$$
P \uparrow \rightarrow D \downarrow 
$$

$$
P \downarrow \rightarrow D \uparrow 
$$

**Movement along the curve** occurs when price rises or drops

The entire curve can also shift, if these factors change:

- **T**aste/trends
- **R**elated goods
- **I**ncome
- **B**uyers (number of buyers)
- **E**xpectations

If the demand curve shifts right, more of a good is demanded at each given price
