Silicon also has crystal planes (planes on which atoms lie), if you were to cut a crystal structure</p>
<p>Silicon crystals exhibit <strong>anisotrophic behaviors</strong> - behave differently from different directions</p>
<p>Silicon wafers come in different flavors - what type of doping (n or p type) or which crystal plane is planar to the surface of the wafer</p>
<p>Insulators have electrons all in their valence band - they are held tightly by the nucleus, cannot conduct<br>
Semiconductors have electrons both in the conduction band, where electrons can move more freely and conduct<br>
Metals have their valence and conduction band next to each other, so electrons can move freely between valence and conduction band.</p>
<p>The gap between the conduction and valence bands is known as the <strong>energy gap</strong></p>
<p>Insulators - high energy gap, electrons can't get enough energy to jump to the conduction band at room temp</p>
<p>Semiconductors - lower energy gap, electrons can jump to conduction band at room temperature</p>
<p>Once electrons jump to the conduction band, it leaves behind a hole (positive ion charge), which can move as well</p>
<p>N-type doping - extra electrons near the conduction band<br>
P-type doping - extra holes near the valence band</p>
<p><strong>Both make the semiconductor more conductive</strong></p>
<p>What happens in a PN junction? (where the P and N type silicon meets)?</p>
<p>The electrons will diffuse and the charges of the P and N type silicon will balance</p>
<p>This is called the depletion zone</p>
<p>Then, since the charges are concentrated, we can calculate the <a href="electric-field">Electric Field</a> and integrate it to get  the <a href="electrical-potential">Electrical Potential</a> (voltage)</p>
<p><strong>There is an electric potential when the two types of doped silicon meet, because of the depletion zone</strong></p>
<p><img src="Pasted%20image%2020220628111252.png" alt="Pasted image 20220628111252.png"></p>
<p>By applying voltage between the N and P silicon of the PN-junction, we can widen or shrink the depletion zone, increasing or decreasing the potential difference</p>
<p>In forward bias (P to positive voltage), the junction has a greater ability to conduct electricity</p>
<p>In reverse bias mode, the depletion region grows and the junction has a lesser ability to conduct electricity</p>
<p>This is a diode - electricity can flow only in one direction</p>

NMOS transistor</p>
<p>If there is a voltage applied to the gate, the gate will be forward biased - then current can flow from the source to the drain.</p>
<p>The current flow is linearly proportional to the gate bias, up to saturation</p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"mdContent":"\u003cp\u003eMaterial phases:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCrystalline: repetitive unit cell\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSalts, silicon, sugar\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLong range order - atoms are always in known position\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePolycrystalline:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIndividual grains of crystalline material\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eShort range order - only orderly in an individual grain\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAmorphous\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNo order\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRandom orientation of atoms\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGlass (SiO2)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome materials (polymers) can have a combination of material domains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilicon - diamond cubic structure (4 covalent bonds between atoms)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"Pasted%20image%2020220628105235.png\" alt=\"Pasted image 20220628105235.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Unit cell\" of silicon crystal:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"Pasted%20image%2020220628105240.png\" alt=\"Pasted image 20220628105240.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSilicon also has crystal planes (planes on which atoms lie), if you were to cut a crystal structure\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilicon crystals exhibit \u003cstrong\u003eanisotrophic behaviors\u003c/strong\u003e - behave differently from different directions\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilicon wafers come in different flavors - what type of doping (n or p type) or which crystal plane is planar to the surface of the wafer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsulators have electrons all in their valence band - they are held tightly by the nucleus, cannot conduct\u003cbr\u003e\nSemiconductors have electrons both in the conduction band, where electrons can move more freely and conduct\u003cbr\u003e\nMetals have their valence and conduction band next to each other, so electrons can move freely between valence and conduction band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gap between the conduction and valence bands is known as the \u003cstrong\u003eenergy gap\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsulators - high energy gap, electrons can't get enough energy to jump to the conduction band at room temp\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSemiconductors - lower energy gap, electrons can jump to conduction band at room temperature\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce electrons jump to the conduction band, it leaves behind a hole (positive ion charge), which can move as well\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eN-type doping - extra electrons near the conduction band\u003cbr\u003e\nP-type doping - extra holes near the valence band\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBoth make the semiconductor more conductive\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happens in a PN junction?
