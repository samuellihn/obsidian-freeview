To find the derivative of two functions in a fraction/divided:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\Bigg[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\Bigg]  =  \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}
$$

Numerator is **not** commutative

$g(x)$ must **not be zero**

Not every function needs the quotient rule - try to bypass it if possible

If dividing by a constant, multiply by the reciprocal of the constant and use the [[Derivative Rules#Constant Multiple Rule]] and [[Power Rule]] instead
