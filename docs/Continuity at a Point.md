A function is **continuous** at a point $c$ if both:

1. $f(c)$ exists
2. $lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ exists
3. $lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)$


If there is a discontinuity at a point, the function will not be continuous at that point

Jump discontinuities are **not continuous** because the limit does not exist

Holes/removable discontinuities are **not continuous** because although $f(c)$ may exist, it may not be equal to the limit
