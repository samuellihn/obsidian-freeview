**Excise Tax** - per-unit tax on a specific good

When a government imposes an excise, tax it is ambiguous who will bear (most of) the tax burden, **regardless** of who the tax is imposed on

For an excise tax $t$:

$$t = |P_C - P_P|$$
> Difference between the price price paid by consumers and price sold by consumers

When tax is imposed on consumers:

> Demand curve shifts **upward** (price paid at each quantity is higher), creating a new equilibrium quantity:
> $Q* \rightarrow Q'$
> Then, three prices are established: $P*$ - old equilibrium price, $P_C$ - new price paid by consumers, $P_P$ - new sale price for producers
> $t = P_C - P_P$

> Same effect: $Q* \rightarrow Q'$, three prices, except now $t = P_P - P_C$
