Any conductor in electrostatic equilibrium will have **no** electric field inside of it

> If it is metal and it is in electrostatic equilibrium, $E = 0$
> If there is an electric field inside, the charges would be moving

Charge will end up on the edges (surfaces) of the conductor

Using [[Gauss's Law]], we can see that $E = 0$, so $\phi = 0$, therefore $q_{en} = 0$ for a Gaussian just smaller than the conductor

This can be used in conjunction with [[Gauss's Law]] to find unknown charges, as we know that there is no electric field, therefore the enclosed charge also equals zero

$\vec{E}$ just outside the metal is equal to $\frac{\sigma_{local}}{\epsilon_0}$ ($\sigma$ is local charge density per area)

$$
E = \frac{\sigma_{local}}{\epsilon_0}
$$

> Think of the Gauss's law equality $\frac{\sigma_local * A}{epsilon_0} = \oint{E \cdot dA}$ for a Gaussian just above the surface


$\vec{E}$ direciton just outside of the surface will be [[Surface Normal|Normal]] to the surface

All points on and inside the metal will be at the same [[Electrical Potential]]

> $E$ is zero for the metal, so the [[Electrical Potential as Path Integral]] is zero as well 
> if the metal had different potentials, they would redistribute and be in electrostatic equilibrium again

 The surface charge density $\sigma$ will be greater at the sharper areas at the metal. The electric field strength will thus be greatest just outside the sharpest points on the metal.

 $$
 E = \frac{\sigma_{local}}{\epsilon_0}
 $$

> Even though there is more charge for a larger (smoother) piece of metal, the surface charge density will still be higher if the potentials are the same, **since area is squared and charge isn't**
