# Matrix form:

Coefficient matrix or augmented matrix

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\
9&10&11&12
\end{bmatrix}
$$

#  Row picture:

Graph of everything in the cartesian coordinate system, the resultant graph will have three planes

Solution will either have three planes interesecting at a point or three planes intersecting at a line

Or no intersection at all

**Not always lines: "linear" only implies that the variables are always raised to the first power**

# Column picture:

Weighted sum of vectors

$$
x \Big[\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\ 5 \\ 9 \end{smallmatrix}\Big] 
+ y \Big[\begin{smallmatrix} 2 \\ 6 \\ 10 \end{smallmatrix}\Big]
+ z \Big[\begin{smallmatrix} 3 \\ 7 \\ 11 \end{smallmatrix}\Big]
= \Big[\begin{smallmatrix} 4 \\ 8 \\ 12 \end{smallmatrix}\Big] $$

# Only three cases, regardless of dimensionality:

- One solution
- Infinite solutions
- No solution at all

A linear system is **consistent** when at least one solution exists

Once we know the value of **one** of the variables, we can assume the system is consistent (substitute into other equations to find answer)

If we end up with something like $0x + 0y + 0z = 3$ $[\begin{matrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 3\end{matrix}]$  in any row then we can assume the system is inconsistent
