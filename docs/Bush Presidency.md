# Bush Foreign Policy

19.4.1

American became an unopposed superpower when the Soviet Union collapsed

Bush had a lot of foreign policy experience, WWII veteran, U. S. ambassador to UN, director of CIA, Reagan's VP. 

Latin American experienced new wave of democracy in late 1980s-early 90s. Free elections in Nicaragua, end of civil war in El Salvador, fall of dictator in Chile.

Latin American supply of drugs increased, so in alignment with War on Drugs (since Nixon), Bush administration arrested druglords. Bush sent 12k+ U. S. troops to invade Panama, arrest **Manual Noreiga**, military strongman/dictator and druglord

**Tiananmen Square** protest was crushed by CCP and killed many protestors, action was condemned heavily by Bush administration and U. S. suspended arms sales to China. 

> Did not cut off ties with the country, engaged with China economically and diplomatically

In South Africa, anti-aparthied movement strengthened in late 1980s, many private U. S. firms withdrew investments from South Africa, Congress imposed economic sanctions. Bush met with Nelson Mandela, leader of anti-aparthied movement, and democracy was brought to South African in 1994.

After fall of Soviet Union, Yugoslavia turned into a civil war, Bush didn't send troops for fear of another Vietnam. Didn't back UN plan to restore peace in Bosnia (republic derived from Yugoslavia conflict) until 1992

U. S. protected human rights in Somalia, marines landed in Dec. 1992 to help establish cease-fire between warlords and feed starving Somalians. Applauded by basically everyone.

# Persian Gulf War

19.4.2

Iraq invaded Kuwait in August1990, Saddam Hussein, Iraq's dictator, wanted Kuwait's oil deposits. Hussein would control 20% of oil produced around the world if he had Kuwait. 

U. S. feared how Hussein would use this influence, also didn't want him to try to invade Saudi Arabia for their oil as well. Bush made it clear that he wouldn't tolerate Iraq's aggression, backed UN resolution that demanded that Iraqi troops withdraw.

700k troops assembled in Saudi Arabia by late fall, incl. 500k American troops. Bush hoped that the troops would make Hussein withdraw his soldiers, but Bush also got Congress approval to use force if necessary to get Iraq out of Kuwait.

**Operation Desert Storm** was five weeks onf aerial bombardment of Iraqi forces, Iraq responded with Scud missiles. Did serious damage to Iraqi forces. 

Coalition troops stormed into Kuwait, Iraqi troops surrended/fled, and Iraq agreed to UN cease-fire. Iraq lost 25k+ soldiers, U. S. lost 148. Coalition did not go further than getting Iraq out of Kuwait. Bush approval skyrocketed.

U. S. remained in the region to help refugees and establish no-fly zones over Iraq. Saddam Hussein and supporters resented his presence, U. S. resentment also grew in Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm. Resentment may have led to growth of al Qaeda.
