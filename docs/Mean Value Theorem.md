If $f(x)$ is continuous **and** differentiable on the **closed** interval, , then:

$$
\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c) \ at \ some \ a \leq c\leq b
$$

At **at least ** one point, the derivative will be equal to the slope of the secant line if the function is "well behaved"

> These are called **existence theorems**

This means multiple points can equal the slope of the tangent line!

We can solve for x-value where the derivative equals the slope

$$
AROC = f'(x)
$$

Basically just the [[Intermediate Value Theorem]] but with the first derivative

Different from the other theorems because the function has to be differentiable (remember, differentiability implies continuity)

If the function isn't differentiable/continuous, there may still be a point where AROC equals IROC, but we cannot justify it with the Mean Value Theorem
> One-way theorem, conclusion does not imply theorem
Needs to be continuous on the **closed** interval, but only differentiable on the **open** interval 
> Bounds need to be continuous, but they do not need to be differentiable (in the case of vertical tangent, etc.)
> If it meets these conclusiosn (continuous on closed, differentiable on open), the MVT applies to the entire **closed** interval
