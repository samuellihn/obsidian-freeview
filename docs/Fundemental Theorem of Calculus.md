If $$f(x) = \int_{a}^{x}{g(t)\ dt}$$ then $$f'(x) = g(x)$$

In summary,

$$f'(x)=g(x) =\frac{d}{dx} \int_{a}^{x}{g(t)\ dt}$$

The integral is the anti-derivative (or accumulation of change), the function we are accumulating $g'(t)$ is the **rate of change** of our integral, $f'(x)$

**The fundemental theorem of calculus states that the integral and derivative are inverses**

If our upper bound is also a function, we need to apply the **chain rule:**
$$\frac{d}{dx}\int_c^{h(x)}{f(t)dt} = f(h(x))*h'(x)$$
