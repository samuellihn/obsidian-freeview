> Utility can be **diminishing** - consumers have a "taste for variety" and do not prefer too much of one thing
Utility can go **down** - too much of one thing is a bad thing

**Marginal Utility** - the additional utility gained by consuming 1 more unit of the good

$$MU = \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta Q}$$

> The marginal utility goes negative when opportunity cost is unfavorable 

**Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility:** The marginal utility **always decreases as quantity increases**
