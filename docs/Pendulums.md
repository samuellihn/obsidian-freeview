Period of a pendulum: 

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
$$

Similar to the [[Spring Harmonics]] period equation

Mass does not matter (cancels out)

Total energy will always be conserved, between the GPE of the initial position and the kinetic energy in the bottom-most position (middle of the stroke)

$$
 E_{total} = mgh + \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

Pendulum bobs experience **centripetal force** when the pendulum bob is moving. This force is from the string, only applies when the pendulum bob is moving in a circle.
