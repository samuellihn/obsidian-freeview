# Heat transfer and thermal equilibrium
-   Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy

    -   In high temperature systems, molecules have on average a higher kinetic energy

    -   In low temperature systems, molecules have on average a lower kinetic energy

-   Heat is transferred from high temperature (high energy) to low temperature (low energy) systems
-   Particles collide

    -   Particles with higher kinetic energy can collide with particles with lower and transfer some of the kinetic energy

-   Eventually, kinetic energy of all particles is equalized

    -   Thermal equilibrium

        -   Average kinetic energy is the same => both systems are at the same temperature
