# Valence electrons and ionic compounds
-   Valence electrons

    -   "Outer shell electrons"

    -   Electrons in outermost s and p shells

    -   Important because they determine the likelihood that two electrons will form a chemical bond
-   Ion charges

    -   Typical charges of atoms in ionic compounds are determined by their

        -   location on the periodic table

        -   the number of valence electrons

    -   Electrons will take the easiest path to becoming stable (having a full valence shell)
-   Transition metals

    -   Often have multiple possible ion charges

    -   Parenthesis in compound name indicates positive ion charge. Ex. Copper (II) Bromide => Cu^2+^ + Br^-^ => CuBr~2~

    -   Lose electrons differently

        -   Will lose higher level s subshell electrons before losing lower level d electrons
