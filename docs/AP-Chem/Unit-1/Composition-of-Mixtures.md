# Composition of Mixtures
-   A mixture contains more than one pure substance

    -   More than one type of particle
-   Mixtures have variable compositions

    -   Depends on the (amounts of) the pure substances they contain

        -   Relative amounts
-   **Solutions** are an example of mixtures
-   There can be:

    -   Mixtures of two elements (X + Y~2~)

    -   Pure substances (XY~2~)

    -   Elements (X and Y~2~)

    -   Mixtures of both elements and pure substances (X+XY~2~)

    -   Mixtures of pure substances (XY~2~+AB)
-   The elemental composition of a mixture can be used to determine the (relative amounts) of the pure substances that it is made of

    -   **Elemental analysis:** finding the relative mass of 1+ elements in a mixture

    -   Often used to determine the purity of a substance
