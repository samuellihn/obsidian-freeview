# Redox reactions

    -   Substance that loses electrons => oxidized

    -   Substance that gains electrons => reduced

        -   OIL RIG - Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain
-   Oxidation of one substance ALWAYS corresponds with the reduction of another

    -   Electrons need to come from/go somewhere
-   To balance redox equations

    -   Construct half-reactions



Al(s) + Cu^2+^(aq) => Al^3+^(aq) + Cu(s)
-   Al is oxidized
-   Cu is reduced

Half reaction 1: oxidation

Al(s) => Al^3+^(aq) **+ 3e^-^**

Half reaction 2: Reduction

Cu^2+^(aq) **+ 2e^-^** => Cu(s)



Electrons lost by Al **must be equal to** electrons gained by Cu!

How to make equal? Scalar multiply:

**2**[Al(s) => Al^3+^(aq) **+ 3e^-^**] => 2Al(s) => 2Al^3+^(aq) **+ 6e^-^**

**3**[Cu^2+^(aq) **+ 2e^-^** => Cu(s)] => 3Cu^2+^(aq) **+ 6e^-^** => 3Cu(s)



Electrons are now equal (6e^-^ => 6e^-^)

Combine 2 half-reactions:

2Al(s) + 3Cu^2+^(aq) + 6e^-^ => 2Al^3+^(aq) **+** 6e^-^ + 3Cu(s)

Cancel like terms (electrons)

2Al(s) + 3Cu^2+^(aq) => 2Al^3+^(aq) + 3Cu(s)

Equation is now balanced!
