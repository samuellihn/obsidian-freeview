# Stoichiometry
-   **Stoichiometry: The study of the relationships between the relative quantities of substances taking part in a chemical reaction**
-   Used to predict amount of products produced or amount of reactants required

    -   Involving...

        -   Moles or grams

        -   Aqueous solutions

        -   Gases
-   Used to convert between mass, quantity (moles), liters, etc
-   **Limiting reactant** - reactant whose quantity is limiting the amount of the other reactant that can react
-   **Excess reactant** - some of this will be left over because there is not enough limiting reactant
-   Coefficients provide mole ratios - for x amount of element a, y amount of element b is required and vice versa

    -   Use mole ratios to determine limiting and excess reactants

    -   Increasing the amount of limiting reactant will increase the amount of products produced, until the limiting reactant is no longer the limiting reactant

    -   Increasing the amount of excess reactant will not increase the amount of products produced
