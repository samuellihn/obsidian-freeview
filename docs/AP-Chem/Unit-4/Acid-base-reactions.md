# Acid-base reactions

**Neutralization Reaction**
-   When an acid and base are mixed, a neutralization reaction occurs
-   Usually, neutralization reactions produce water and a salt

    -   Salt: an ionic compound made of a cation (from the base) and an anion (from the acid)

    -   Acid + base => salt + water
-   HCL (aq) (acid) + NaOH (aq) (base) => NaCl(aq)(salt) + H~2~O (aq)(water)

    -   HCl => strong acid = completely disassociates

    -   NaOH => strong base = completely disassociates

    -   H^+^ + Cl^-^ + Na^+^ + OH^-^ => Na^+^ + Cl^-^ + H~2~O

        -   H^+^ + OH^-^ => H~2~O

    -   Only strong acids/bases disassociate completely

        -   Weak acids/bases do not!

**Bronsted-Lowry Acid-base reaction**
-   Involves transfer of 1 or more protons

    -   Proton = H+
-   Baad => bases accept acids donate
-   Acid => proton donor

    -   Ex. HCl => Cl^+^
-   Base => proton acceptor

    -   Ex. H~2~O => H~3~O^+^
-   Conjugate base pairs:

    -   Acid (donates proton) and becomes conjugate base

    -   Base (accepts a proton) and becomes conjugate acid
-   NOTE: Bronsted-Lowry bases include BOTH base and conjugate bases

    -   Conjugate base, base both count as a B-L base in questions
-   In aqueous acid-base reactions water can:

    -   Behave like an acid and donate a proton
