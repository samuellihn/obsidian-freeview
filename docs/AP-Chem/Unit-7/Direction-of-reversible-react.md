# Direction of reversible reactions

What happens when the rate of reaction in one direction is greater than that of the other?
-   If rate of forward reaction > rate of reverse reaction:

    -   Net conversion of reactants to products

    -   Forward reaction is **favored**

    -   And vice versa: reverse > forward => net conversion products to reactants => reverse reaction favored
-   In equilibrium, forward rate = backward rate, **neither** direction is favored

    -   **Only rates** have to be equal: not concentrations
-   If a reversible reaction reaches completion, this means the products and reactants are at equilibrium
