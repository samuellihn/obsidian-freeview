# Reaction mechanisms and rate laws

    -   The SLOWEST step is the RATE DETERMINING STEP
-   Stoichiometry coefficients CANNOT be used to determine the orders of a reaction

    -   Rate is dependent on ACTUAL collisions

        -   Overall chemical equations with more than 2 reactants are EXTREMELY UNLIKELY to happen
-   Coefficients from elementary reactions, however, can be used
-   The order (in the rate law) of each reactant of a chemical reaction is equal to its coefficient

    -   Ex:

        -   ![](../media/Unit-5-Reaction-mechanisms-and-rate-laws-image1.png){width="2.9583333333333335in" height="0.3333333333333333in"}

        -   ![](../media/Unit-5-Reaction-mechanisms-and-rate-laws-image2.png){width="2.71875in" height="0.34375in"}

    -   Or:

        -   ![](../media/Unit-5-Reaction-mechanisms-and-rate-laws-image3.png){width="4.291666666666667in" height="0.34375in"}

        -   ![](../media/Unit-5-Reaction-mechanisms-and-rate-laws-image4.png){width="3.6875in" height="0.34375in"}
-   Elementary step names:

    -   1 molecule involved: unimolecular

    -   2 molecule involved: bimolecular

    -   3 molecule involved: termolecular (not very probable)

        -   In general, elementary steps greater than bimolecular have a very low probability of occurring
