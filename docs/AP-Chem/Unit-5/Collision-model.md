# Collision model
-   Only a small fraction of collisions lead to reactions

    -   Successful collisions:

        -   Have sufficient energy to overcome energy barriers

            -   Required energy => activation energy

        -   Orientations that allow bonds to in a correct manner
-   Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions can be used to estimate:

    -   Fraction of collisions that have enough energy to lead to a reaction

    -   How the fraction behaves based on temperature

-   For a reaction to occur, particles must **collide** with the **proper orientation** with **sufficient energy**

-   Therefore

    -   Increasing the temperature increases average energy of particles, which increases the amount of high-energy collisions => successful reactions occur more often

        -   Also, particles moving faster => more collisions

    -   Increasing density/concentration makes particles collide more often; more potential collisions => more potential reactions
