# VSEPR and Molecule Polarity
-   Some molecules are not polar even though there are polar bonds present

    -   The dipole moments will cancel each other out leaving zero net polarity

-   Net dipole = 0
-   Molecular geometry affects polarity

    -   When a central atom is surrounded symmetrically in 3D space by identical atoms, the molecule is nonpolar

    -   Linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal, and octahedral molecules will be nonpolar as long as the surrounding atoms are identical

    -   A lone pair usually means the molecule is polar

        -   Except:

            -   Linear (2 / 3 / 5) and square planar (4 / 2 / 6) molecules

            -   Dipoles still cancel each other out
