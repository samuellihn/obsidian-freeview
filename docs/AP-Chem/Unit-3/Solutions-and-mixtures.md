# Solutions and mixtures

Solution - A physical combination of any state of matter which macroscopic properties do not vary

Ex. Salt water, Chicken Broth

Another name - **homogeneous** mixture



Dilute - relatively little solute present

Concentrated - relatively large amount of solute

**Heterogeneous** mixtures have varying properties, depending on location in the mixture

Ex. Vegetable Soup - contents change depending on what part you take



How to describe solutions?
-   Molarity (M) - n/V

    -   Moles of solute / liters of solution
-   Solubility - amount of moles solute that can be dissolved in 1 liter of solution (also signified by M)
