# Escalation of forces in Vietnam

**17.2.1**

Operation Rolling Thunder (1965): Bombing campaign against North Vietnam, caused widespread destruction

US soldiers began to take more dominant role in fighting, South Vietnamese forces became secondary: US war, "Americanize" the war effort

Dropped 6 million tons of bombs, 3x that of all combatants during WWII

Dropped Agent Orange and napalm
> **Agent Orange**: killed forests and plant life to reduce Vietnamese advantage, caused health issues to locals

Ground fights were mostly small skirmishes, Ho Chi Minh's soldiers fought light and executed small guerilla attacks against Americans, hoping the Americans would eventually give up and leave

> “Tiger and Elephant” analogy—Tiger could slowly wear down elephant with small attacks
> 
> Vietnam also has time on their hands, while US involvement continues to bleed money

More than 500k US troops in Vietnam by 1968, almost no success

South Vietnamese government had very little support, little progress in defeating North Vietnamese

# Sinking Morale

**17.2.2**

Vietnam War was not about territorial acquisition - no invasion of North Vietnam
> In hopes that Soviets or Chinese did not enter conflict if US invaded 

**Guerilla Warfare**: Small surprise skirmishes that benefitted from increased knowledge of the landscape

The US had no choice but to fight indecisive battles in the wilderness, often surprised by Vietcong

Many began to question US involvement as many had been drafted into service

Vietnam was also unwilling to defend themselves

# Doubt on the Home Front

**17.2.3**

Lack of progress led to doubt among the US population, losing to a county as small as Vietnam

War took away from Great Society plan to fight poverty, improve education, etc., money was simply not enough to supply both the war and Great Society

Government spending lowered unemployment rate, but led to rising prices and inflation

Because of heavy government spending and inflation, Johnson had to raise taxes and cut back on Great Society

Because of this, antiwar movement emerged both in Congress and among the US population

Eventually, two schools of thought:

Hawks | Doves 
-- | --
Supported Johnson's War Policy | Did not support escalation
Believed in Domino Theory | Thought US was fighting local Civil War
Strongly anticommunist | Did not think Vietnam was a vital anticommunist battleground
Conservative men | Liberals, pacifists, students, civil rights leaders

J. William Fulbright emerged as leader of Doves, initially supported Gulf of Tonkin but soon thought Vietnam was a localized Civil War
