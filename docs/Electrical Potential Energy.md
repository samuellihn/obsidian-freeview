Energy stored in the arrangement of objects
Negative of the work done by the conservative force in the arrangement of the system

**In simple forms, the work expended to assemble the system is its potential energy**

Electrical force is conservative, so mechanical (k+p) energy will be conserved in electric systems

Treat it similar to [[Elastic Potential Energy]]

An arrangement of charges will have a non-zero potential energy (unless infinite separation distance)

We need a system with multiple objects in order to have electrical potential energy

$$U_E = k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r}$$

Very similar to the [[Energy of Gravitational Fields]] equation: simply [[Coulomb's Law]] multiplied by distance $r$

Opposite charges: potential energy will be negative (attraction)
Same charges: potential energy will be positive (repulsion)
