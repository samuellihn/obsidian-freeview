Can tell whether a series diverges based on the behavior of another related series


Series are related as follows:

If we have two series, 

$$\sum{a_n}, \sum{b_n}$$
And $a_n \geq 0$ and $b_n \geq 0$ and $a_n \leq b_n$ for all $n$,

If $\sum{b_n}$ is convergent, then so is $\sum{a_n}$

> If the larger of the two converges, so will the smaller

If $\sum{a_n}$ is divergent, then so is $\sum{b_n}$

> If the smaller of the two diverges, so will the larger

We can select a similar-using series (that we know: p-series, geometric, etc.), and logically compare the values of the two series

**Make sure to select the correct series: if the series we select is larger and diverges, smaller and converges, it will not tell us anything about the other series**
