$$R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$$
The equivalent resistance of a particular path is equal to the **sum of the resistances** on that path

Using [[Kirchoff's Loop Rule]], we can say that,

$$V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$$
And for an equivalent resistor,
$$V_{total} = IR_{eq}$$
Therefore, 

$$IR_{eq} = IR_1 + IR_2 + IR_3$$
Removing $I$, 

$$R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$$
