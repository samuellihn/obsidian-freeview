To take the derivative of two multiplied functions?

$$
\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) \ g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
$$

**Do not simply take the derivatives of the two functions and multiply them together**

The product rule is commutative

You may not need to use the product rule if you don't have to: try to "clean up" the original function first

> Example: expand a factored polynomial
