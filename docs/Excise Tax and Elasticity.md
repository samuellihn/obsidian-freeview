**[[Price Elasticity of Demand|Elasticity]]** determines who bears the burden of an [[Excise Tax]]

If $E_D < E_S$ (Demand is more **inelastic** than supply), consumers bear more of the tax burden

> Consumers would rather pay the tax than stop buying the good

If $E_S < E_D$ (Supply is more **inelastic** than demand), consumers bear more of the tax burden

> Producers would rather pay the tax than stop selling the good

If demand is **perfectly inelastic** ($E_D = 0$), consumers bear **all** the burden of an excise tax

> Consumers **cannot** leave the market and **must** pay the tax

Similarly, if supply is **perfectly inelastic** (E_S = 0), producers bear **all** the burden

If supply and demand are equally elastic, the tax burden is split evenly. in addition, $P_C - P* = P* - P_P$
