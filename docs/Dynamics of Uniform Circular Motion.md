Objects in UCM must have a force pulling them towards the center of the circle

$$
\sum{F_r} = ma_R = m\frac{v^2}{r}
$$

Centripital force can be caused by tension force (tension of string on ball)

On a down curve:

$$
\sum{F} = F_N - mg = m\frac{v^2}{r}
$$

On an up curve:

$$
\sum{F} = F_N - mg = -m\frac{v^2}{r}
$$

The net force that causes acceleration should **always be towards the center of the circle.** 

 MInimum velocity for an object on a string to make it over the top of a circle:

 $$
 v = \sqrt{gr}
 
 
 
 
 
 
 $$

When the tension $<0$ and there is no tension force, the object will not conitnue in circular motion

In order for an object to complete a loop, some normal force must be created (meaning the object is still in contact with the loop at the top)
