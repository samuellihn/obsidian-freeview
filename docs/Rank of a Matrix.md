The rank of a matrix $A$, denoted as $rank \ A$, is the [[Dimension of a Subspace|dimension]] of the [[Column Space]] of $A$

Since pivot columns for the [[Basis of a Subspace|basis for the column space]] of $A$, the rank of a matrix is the number of pivot columns it has

This also gives a useful insight to the dimensionality of the null space, $Nul \ A$ - since the rank of the matrix is the number of pivot columns, the dimensionality of $Nul \ A$ is the number of free variables or non-pivot columns

Therefore, given a matrix $A$ with $n$ columns:

$$rank \ A + dim \ Nul \  A = n$$
