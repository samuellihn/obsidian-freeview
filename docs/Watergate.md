# Watergate

18.6.6

Burglars had tried to break in to the Democratic Party Headquarters at the Watergate complex

Burglars were tried in 1973, one of them [^1] said that Nixon administration had been involved in the break-in

> Later publicized by Washington Post, who reported that the burglary attempt was tied to the Nixon administration

Nixon repeatedly asserted innocence, even after his aides had resigned, public disagreed - <20% of Americans thought he was honest

Tested relationship between 3 branches of gov't - how far could/would Congress to go prosecute him? What evidence can the courts demand? Does the presidency need to follow the court's decision?

Spiro Agnew resigned in fall 1973, Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to become his new VP [^2]

> Made Nixon more vulnerable to impeachment because Gerald Ford, the new Vice President, was actually viable as President

Was revealed that Nixon was secretly taping Oval Office conversations, so people thought these conversations might contain information to make him guilty

Nixon refused to turn the tapes over to the prosecutor, claiming executive privilege

> **Executive Privilege:** President has the right to keep certain information confidential

Supreme court ruled in *United States v. Nixon* that the tapes didn't fall under executive privilege and ordered Nixon to turn the tapes over

Tapes were missing crucial information but still enough for the House to vote on impeachment, charged Nixon with:

- obstruction of justice
- misuse of power
- refusal to comply with House subpeona

Nixon recognized that he might be voted into trial and convicted, so he resigned on August 9, 1974

> Still unknown of Nixon's involvement in the burglary, but almost certain that Nixon took part in the cover-up
> Investigations also reveal that Nixon had abused presidential power other ways in securing reelection

## Impact

Damaged reputation of presidency and made the public less confident in the government

% of Americans who believed that government statements were true went from 80 to 33%

Congress passed reforms to restore public confidence

- Federal Election Campaign Act limited money individuals could give to political candidates to limit corruption
- Made procedure for naming counsel to investigate charges against White House

Also showed that nation could go through a crisis and that checks and balances worked

> Congress and Supreme Court checked power of the president

Demonstrated that not even the president can be above the law
