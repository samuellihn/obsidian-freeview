A market that combines elements of both [[Monopoly|monopolies]] and [[Perfect Competition]] - most markets in the real world embody a blend of market power and competition

- **Large number of sellers (>10)**
- **Product differentiation**
- **Free entry and exit**
- **Price makers (due to product differentiation**
- **More info is available (than a monopoly)**

Supply and demand curve is the same as a monopoly - downward-sloping demand curve, profit maximization when $P > MR = MC$

The goal for a monopolistic competitive firm is to create a high markup due to product differentiation - it behaves exactly the same as a monopoly in the short run

However, in the long run, firms can enter and exit the market (albeit not as easily), which creates the [[Zero-profit Condition]] seen in perfect competition - firms make zero economic profit in the long run

Monopolistically competitive producers don't operate at the efficient point (minimum of ATC) as they wouldn't maximize profits this way

However, - when $P=ATC$, demand curve is tangent to average total cost, but still higher than marginal cost because of the markup - therefore, monopolistically competitive firms do want to attract more buyers (advertising)
