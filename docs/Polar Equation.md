A polar equation is graphed on the **polar coordinate system**, a coordinate system where radius $r$ away from the center is based on angle $\theta$

$$
r = f(\theta)
$$

Very similar to the [[Unit Circle]]

A polar equation can be converted to a rectangular equation ([[Parametric Equation]]) with:

$$
\sin\theta = \frac{y}{r}
$$

$$
\cos\theta = \frac{x}{r}
$$

$$
x = r\cos\theta
$$

$$
y = r\sin\theta
$$
