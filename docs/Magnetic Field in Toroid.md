Toroid is a torus with wire wrapped around it

Seen on many electronics (referred to as "coils")

Field lines will be circular and go in one direction

To find the current near the toroid, apply [[Ampere's Law]]

Even though this is all one single wire, we sum the current flowing through each wire separately

> If there's 2 amps flowing through the toroid wire, the total current would still be $2 \times number \ of \ wires$, even though it's all one wire

Dot product can be taken out, $B$ is uniform and can be taken out

After applying Ampere's law, the magnetic field due to a toroid at a distance $r$ from the center is 

$$
B = \frac{\mu_0 NI}{2\pi r}
$$

> So long as we stay outside the inner ring of wires, and inside the outer ring of wires

However, inside the inner ring of wires or outside the outer ring, there is **no magnetic field**

> Inside: no enclosed current at all, no magnetic field
> Outside: no enclosed **net** current, since we have an equal amount of + and - wires, so the currents cancel out
