A **market** is a network of buyers and sellers who exchange goods and services

A market will not exist if market activity (buyers and sellers) does not happen

**Competitive market**- a very large number of buyers and sellers (perfectly competitive - infinite buyers/sellers)

> This means that buyers and sellers are **price takers** - no one entity sets the market price
