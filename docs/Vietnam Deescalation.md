# Attempts to withdraw from Vietnam
17.4.1

Nixon promised "peace with honor" as his presidential campaign

Peace talks: 
- Americans and South Vietnamese wanted all communist troops out of South Vietnam and wanted all POW withdrawn
- North Vietnamese wanted complete American withdrawal and formation of a South Vietnam coalition government that had representatives from the Vietcong
- North Vietnam didn't compromise its original position because they thought they could still win, South Vietnam refused to have an agreement that compromised its security, Nixon didn't accept N. Vietnam's terms either

Tried to gradually pull out American troops and transfer the burden of war to the South Vietnamese (ARVN)

**Vietnamization**: U. S. troops would slowly withdraw as ARVN assumed combat duties

> Overall Effect: Vietnamization didn't drastically increase the chances of winning the war against the Communists

> U. S. would not be in front lines but still provide aid

Nixon ordered secret bombing of Ho Chi Minh Trail in Cambodia to reduce flow of supplies to the Communists
- Controversial, because it brought yet another country be affected by the war
- Undermined the neutral government in Cambodia

# Intensification of Antiwar Movement
17.4.2

Nixon's foreign policy wanted 3 things:
- Peace with Honor
- Security for South Vietnam
- Int'l respect for U. S. foreign policy

However, antiwar activists wanted:
- War ended
- American troops out of Vietnam, on any terms

> Nixon found it difficult to satisfy his own goals and the movement

Nixon ordered ground attack on N. Vietnamese Army and Vietcong bases in Cambodia, also aid fight against N. Vietnam-backed communist movement Khmer Rouge

Nixon said the war was a measure of the commitment of the U. S. to preserve freedom around the war—world policeman

> If, when the chips are down, the world’s most powerful nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations . . . throughout the world ~Nixon 1970

Land assault into Cambodia seized weapons but didn't break the negotiation stalemate
- Angered antiwar activists as Nixon had widened the war
- Many college protests ensued, as Nixon had just invaded a neutral country

Many of the college protests turned violent
- **Kent State Killings**: national guard brought in to calm protests, confrontation between students and nat. guard, students threw rocks and bottles. 
- One guardsmen thought he heard a sniper shot, so he started shooting at the protesters and others did too. Killed four students
- **Jackson University**: confrontation between students and police, two students died

Some counterprotests also started, from people who supported the president. Some of these confrontations between antiwar and counterprotestors turned violent and attracted national attention (through the media)

**My Lai massacre, March 1968:** American forces killed between 400-500 civilians in the village of My Lai, as many American soldiers at this point had been killed by Vietcong posing as civilians
- Inadequate military investigation of the tragedy
- Eventually photos during the event were published in March 1971, and the lieutenant in charge was convicted
- Overall, news shocked Americans and spurred antiwar movement

**Pentagon Papers**: history of America's involvement in Vietnam, leaked to NY Times
- Nixon tried to block publication, Supreme Court said he couldn't
- Revealed that leaders involved in Vietnam didn't fully inform Americans of the involvement and lied to Congress occasionally
- Turned even more Americans against the war

# Vietnam War Ends
17.4.3

2/3 of Americans in 1971 wanted withdrawal of American troops, even if that meant the Communists would take S. Vietnam

U.S. and N. Vietnam came to a peace settlement, but N. Vietnam refused to sign

**Christmas Bombings** eventually resumed N. Vietnam peace talks

In 1973, S. Vietnam, N. Vietnam, and Vietcong signed **Paris Peace Accords**
- Ceasefire
- U. S. troop withdrawal from S. Vietnam
- NLF (Vietcong) would become a political party in S. Vietnam
- Noncommunist gov't would remain in power, for now
- American POWs would be returned
- N and S. Vietnam POW would be exchanged but N. Vietnamese troops would remain in S. Vietnam

ARVN without American support was no match for Soviet-supplied N. Vietnamese army, and N. Vietnamese took Saigon and Vietnam was unified under the communists

# Effects of Vietnam War
17.4.4

## Death Tolls

58k American soldiers died in Vietnam, 300k wounded

Vietnamese death toll most likely >2 million

Peace and end of war created other problems in SE Asia

## SE Asia

Communist regimes came to power in Laos and Cambodia, Cambodian Khmer Rouge unleashed genocide killing everyone with ties to the West or previous Cambodian govt's 
- \>2 million Cambodians died in labor camps or were executed
- However, Communist influences came from nationalism, not outside influence
- Were especially intolerant of outside (Soviet, Chinese) influences - China even supported anticommunist Khmer Rouge 

## Veterans

American soldiers that came home were not fully appreciated by the American populace, partly because of the divisive nature of the war

Some veterans also suffered physical/psychological ailments

Americans didn't fully honor Vietnam veterans until ~1980s
- Vietnam Veterans Memorial created in 1982
- Some veterans given the Congressional Medal of Honor for their heroism

## Politically
Great Society died because Vietnam War was too expensive
Undermined America's trust in their leaders

**War Powers Act:** restricted President's powers by requiring him to consult Congress within 48 hours of committing American forces on a foreign conflict
- Direct response to the Tonkin Resolution
- Stop the growth of "imperial presidency"
- Still is a constitutional issue today, whether Congress or President should have authority to initiate war

Left Americans with "war fatigue", where the U. S. was discouraged to use force in foreign conflicts fearing "another Vietnam"

## Economically
US spent $738 billion (2011) to fight the War, and another $270b for veteran benefits, so total cost more than 1 trillion and increasing

War was end of post WWII economic prosperity

Militarized American industry, warping its economic prowess

interestingly, didn't cut into amount of money spent on educaton, public school spending increased 58 percent in 1960s and 27 percent in 1970s

Economy in 1970s had lots of crisis as a result of Vietnam War
