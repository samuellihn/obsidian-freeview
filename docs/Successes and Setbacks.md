## Violence

16.3.2

- Not much legitimate change, anger and frustration because minorities were still poor and discrimination continued
- Many race riots erupted, including Watts Loss Angeles where the National Guard had to restore order. Also in Newark and Detroit, major property damage and deaths. 
- Frightened many white Americans, blacks were being violent against whites and police
- Kerner Commission: concluded that long-term discrimination was the leading cause of violence, recommended establishing programs to overcome urban ghettos, where many minorities lived
- Findings controversial, said federal spending would reward rioters, ignored other minorities. Ultimately never followed up on because of Vietnam and white backlash
- Private sector created economic opportunities for minorities: low income housing, job-creating enterprises in poor urban districts

## New Civil Rights Groups

16.3.3

- Many African Americans were radicalized, especially young and urban. Disagreed with nonvoilence and integration
- Malcom X converted to Islam, where separation of races was demanded: called for black pride, spread idea of **black nationalism**, a belief in the separate itentity and racial unity of African Americans
- Broke away from Nation of Islam, formed own organization, began to accept whites in a limited capacity. Shot and killed in February 1965. 
- Started a move away from the principle of nonvoilence as true progress was hard to see. Integration also began to be questioned, as this implied reliance on whites
- Black Power: use of economic and political power by Black Americans to gain equality. Whites thought black power = black violence
- Black Panthers: young militant African Americans, patrolled urban neighborhoods with guns to protect from polive abuse, created antipoverty programs. Were not inherently violent, but were not afraid to show power by bearing arms. Sometimes violently confronted police.Influenced by Malcolm X
- Celebrated African American heritage, referred to themselves as "black".
