Fossils are formed when organisms are buried in sediment

> Remnants become petrified, become part of sedimentary rock

The fossils are old as the rock, as they are formed together

Two ways to determine fossil age:

**Relative Age - how deep the fossil is in the ground gives a rough estimate of age**

Older fossils are deeper in the ground, and fossils at approximately the same depth (in a given area) are likely around the same age

> **Law of Superposition** - layers/**strata** of Earth's crust increase in age as depth increaase

**Absolute age - use absolute dating based off of radioactive isotopes**

Uses the [[Half-Life]] of a radioactive isotope found in the organism to determine how long it has been since the organism died

> Comparison of how much stable vs. how much radioactive chemicals are in the organisms, 

Old fossils have very little radioactive isotopes, as most of it has decayed into stable elements
