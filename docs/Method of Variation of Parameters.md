Use for non-homogeneous [[First-order Linear DE]] in the "standard form" $y' + p(x)y = q(x)$

Define the **integrating factor**:

$$m(x) = \exp\left(\int{p(x)}\right)$$
The general solution is then:

$$
y(x) = \frac{1}{m(x)}\left(\int{m(x)q(x)dx} + C \right)
$$

Then, solve for C given the initial condition
