A monopoly's demand curve **is** the market's demand curve, since it is the only producer in its market - following the law of demand, it is therefore downward-sloping

Because of the downward-sloping demand curve, marginal revenue is always less than the price of the good (increasing quantity decreases price for **all** customers)

Creates two effects on total [[Revenue]] **when quantity is increased**:

- Output effect: more output is sold (Q higher), increases total revenue
- Price effect: price falls, which might decrease total revenue

## Profit Maximization

A monopoly does not have a supply curve - since it is a price maker, it can decide how much to supply based on the demand curve.

A monopolist's [[Profit Maximization]] strategy is the same as for competitive firms (see link) - establish $MR = MC$, until the firm is making zero money on the "last unit" sold. However, **in constrast to a competitive firm**, the sale price is **greater than** the marginal revenue:

$$P > MR = MC$$

>  The difference between the price $P$ and marginal revenue/cost $MR = MC$ is called the **markup**
> When the demand curve is linear (and the marginal revenue is not given), the marginal revenue will always be twice as steep as the demand curve, and start at the same point

A monopolist's total profit can be measured by:

$$\pi = (P - ATC) \times Q$$
