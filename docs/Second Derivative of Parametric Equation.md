The [[Higher Order Derivatives]] for parametric equations are written as:

$$
 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}  = \frac{\frac{d}{dt}\Big[\frac{dy}{dx}\Big]}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
$$

> The derivative is being taken with respect to $t$, so we need to "divide by" $dt$ in our higher-order derivative
> Then, we have $\frac{dx}{dt}$ in the denominator

We are still differentiating with respect to $t$, because that is what $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is in terms of

Don't forget to carry over $\frac{dx}{dt}$ to the denominator

The [[Derivative Tests]] can be applied to these derivatives to determine [[Concavity]], so the graphs are still concave up when the second derivative is positive, concave down when second derivative is negative
