[[Morris Worm Report]]
--

## What was the mal-action ? 

A worm that infected 1/10 of the 60000 computers connected to ARPANET within 24 hours
Affected computers at The Pentagon, NASA, Berkeley, Stanford and MIT.

--

Not the first computer virus, but the first worm spread over an internet

> **Worm**: A type of malware that can replicate itself and spread throughout a network without a centralized host.

Happened very early, 1 year before the invention of the World Wide Web

Spread to every connected computer running BSD

--

# How did it work?

Exploited a input buffer overrun in the c gets() routine

Page 5 or 41

What is an input buffer overrun?


--

No malicious actions, but slowed every computer under the weight of unnecessary processing.
- Computers were not fast at a time, so the worm was noticed.
- The code contained nothing that would delete files or cause any other harm to an infected computer

--

## Motivation

Morris later said that he released the worm simply to measure the size of the internet

Design flaw in the program caused the worm to keep replicating until the computer could not hand the load

--

## What was the damage?

Caused computing to slow down for a few days, but caused no lasting harm.

Created processes and temporary files in attempt to replicate itself

Classified as a "white-hat" hack.

Some systems were disabled because of the processing load involved in the replication of the world.


--

## How did it work?

Exploited vulnerabilities on VAX and Sun Microsystems systems, and vulnerabilities in the Unix e-mail delivery software. 

Propagated through TCP connections and or SMTP connections. 

--

## Do we know who was involved? 

- Robert Tappan Morris
- 23-year-old Cornell University Graduate
- Hacked into an MIT terminal to unleash the worm
- Leaked by one of his friends


--

## Did they get punished?

- Yes - Computer Fraud and Abuse Act had been passed the year earlier
- Indicted in 1989, first person indicted under this law
- $10500 fine, three years of probation, 400 hours of community service
- Currently a tenured professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, CSAI Laboratory


--

## Moral Ambiguity

Continues to generate moral ambiguity around the motivation behind Morris' actions
- Program contained no code that could cause harm to infected computers
- However, his arrest under the CFAA states that not only was this hack criminal but one that could harm the government itself

--

Morris's malware simply demonstrated a vulnerability by spreading software that would make computer users aware of the vulnerability
