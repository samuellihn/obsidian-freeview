When two wires are carrying a current, they can put a force on each other

See [[Force on a Current Carrying Wire]]

The force on wire 2 as caused by wire 1 will be:

$$
F=I_2\vec{l}\times \vec{B}_1
$$

And $\vec{B}_{other}$ is $\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r}$, and assuming the wires are parallel, the cross product can cancel out since the field will always be perpendicular to the wire

$$
F=I_2\vec{l}\frac{\mu_0I_1}{2\pi r}
$$

Therefore, per a length of wire $l$, 

$$
\frac{F}{l}=\frac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\pi r}
$$

> Note this isn't an inverse square relationship like [[Electric Field]]s or [[Gravitational Field]]s

Same thing works for moving charges, consider [[Law of Biot-Savart]] when calculating $\vec{B}$
