Private Equity - ownership of a company only available to a select group of people

> As opposed to "public equity" - the stock market (publicly traded companies)

Private equity firms buy up underperforming businesses, makes them profitable, and then sells them

They apply **formally rational logic** to make money

> Little or no investor oversight

However, the substantive logic works against private equity - displaces jobs, makes prices higher for society
