# 17.1.4
**Indochina**: Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos

Indochina was ruled by the French before WWII with an iron fist
- High taxes, harsh colonialism
- Most people were impoverished and dissatisfied, leading to revolution
- Some began to rebel against French exploitative rule

Ho Chi MInh: anti French, eventually embraced communism to lead to a free Vietnam, was then embraced by the Soviets
WWII drastically weakened French imperialism, therefore Minh could start his revolution

Truman sacrifices anti-communist beliefs and vows to fight communism and support French colonialism

> Also to make sure France stays an ally in the Cold War that's still going on

US contributes 2.6b to France war efforts 1950-54

**Domino theory: If a country falls to communism, its neighbors fall to communism as well**

> If Vietnam were to fall to communism, Japan, Phillippines, and Australia might as well

French surrender in 54 after 8 years, Vietnam divided into North (communist) ruled by Minh and South (anti-communist) supported by US

# 17.1.5 US Response

Truman initially only willing to supply money, not troops

**SouthEast Asia Treaty Organization**: similar to NATO but to prevent communism in Southeast Asia (SEATO)

US provided aid to Ngo Dinh Diem, south Vietnam anticommunist leader

Lacked popular support from citizens: was a Catholic in primarily Bhuddist nation, but still supported by US because of his anticommunism

> Signed anti-Bhuddist legislation, failed to enact significant land reforms

At 1956 unification election, US predicted Diem would lose, so he didn't participate at all

**Vietcong**: Communist rebel group in South Vietnam intending to undermine Diem's presidency. Practiced Guerilla warfare

Kennedy sends forces to assist and advise South Vietnamese soldiers

Diem's government continues weakening, so the US overthrows him and finds a new leader

Kennedy dies, diehard anti-communist Johnson comes into power

USS Maddox fired on by torpedo boats, a signal of Vietnamese aggression. Johnson orders airstrike against Vietnam

**Gulf of Tonkin Resolution:** President can take any necessary action to defend American troops from vietnamese aggression

> Effectively gives the President power to use the military, bypassing Congressional allocation of right to declare war
