Use a **decision matrix** to identify pros and cons between different solutions

Once the idea is chosen, we can create:
- Prototypes
- Experiments
- Software
- Safety

Switching from:
- Abstract to concrete
- Qualitative to quantitative
- Rough to detailed design

Plan for multiple revisions!

# To specify the design:

Identify critical function parameters
- Project constraints/requirements
- Estimate limits and sensitivities of parameters

Identify flows and interfaces

- Energy flows
- Material flows
- Information flow

Failure modes and safety risks

- What can go wrong?
- How likely is it to happen?
- What are the consequences?
