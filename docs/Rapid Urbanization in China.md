# Phase 1A

**Mao Era** - urban growth strictly controlled and urban population increased slowly

Strictly controlled rural-to-urban migration

Organized production and consumption through village collectives

Powered by *Hukou*, household registration system, gave different resources and entitlements to urban and rural residents

- Urban hukou: employment, housing, pensions, medical care
- Rural hukou: share of production, land, some medical care

Cities would only hold the number of people for which the government could provide jobs

# Phase 1B

**Market Reforms** - urban population increased at a modest rate to 29%

**Household Responsibility System** - rural hukou guarantees share of rural land

Initial demand for migrant workers that could not live in cities

Small hukou reforms allowed for limited rural-to-urban migration, jobs still limited by work unit system (limited but guaranteed jobs, housing, etc.)

**Township and Village Enterprises** - used inexpensive rural labor and subcontracted work from urban factories/industries

Trade liberalization, capitalist-style enterprise management - need lots of inexpensive labor

State-owned enterprises privatized or restructured

- Employment no longer a guarantee
- End of work units, iron rice bowl
- Export-oriented industry - lots of urban jobs

Meanwhile, agriculture was on the decline

- Agricultural products went down in price, difficult to survive on farming alone
- TVEs closed down, couldn't compete with efficient urban factories

Rural residents sought work in urban areas, but villagers were not educated and discriminated against , and work was temporary and didn't pay well

Migrants would return home to establish a family, and went out to work again

Urban officials wanted inexpensive labor but refused to let them settle - refused social services and public schooling to migrant workers

# Phase 2

**Rapid Urban Development** - urban population soared from 29 to 59%

Housing reform of 1998 - privatized urban housing leads to massive real estate industry

Developers needed rural land on urban periphery to construct housing, and people to live in those houses

> Displaced rural residents into urban housing/cities

Agribusiness - **dragonhead enterprises** - leased land from rural households and removes rural households from villages, directly farming on their land

Local officials and governments generate more revenue from urban real estate and dragonhead enterprises, both in terms of GDP growth and tax revenue

**Tripartite Alliance** - real-estate privatization, dragonhead businesses, local government incentive - pushes for removal of rural residents from their land
# Urban Development

**Three concentrations model** - separate industrial, agricultural, residential zones

- Agricultural zones - dragonhead enterprises and large farmers
- Industrial zones - industrial parks
- Residential zones - concentrates peasants and villagers into apartment buildings

Peasants being turned into proletarians

How does urban gov't free up land?

- Offer urban hukou to households for their land - used to be an attractive offer because of guaranteed entitlements, no longer attractive - gov't has to pay them
- Force

Urban employment is still unstable - informal employment, in all manufacturing, construction, industrial enterprises

# Circular Labor Migration

When rural migrants get sick or cannot find work, they go back to their village

# Urbanization = Prosperity?

Commodification does not equate to  development - more quantifiability does not mean more output and prosperity

Capitalism seeks to minimize labor input to reduce costs, which is problematic in a populous country like China

Household to capitalist production seeks wealth distribution towards the top, concentrating wealth and income

Strategy of rapid urbanization will only succeed if China can integrate millions of rural residents into urban settings each year

Displaced rural residents may be put in a precarious position, rather than a prosperous one
