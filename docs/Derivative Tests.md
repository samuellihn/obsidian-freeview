A function is increasing if its derivative is positive
A function is decreasing if its derivative is negative

A function is increasing/decreasing at a local max/min, use a square bracket**

# First Derivative Test
When a function's derivative goes through zero, the function has a local minimum or maximum at that point

- Positive to negative -> maximum
- Negative to positive -> minimum

> "bounces" off the x-axis do not count, derivative has to go through

# Candidate Test

See [[Absolute Extrema]]

Candidates test can justify the location of absolute extrema
Another existence test, multiple x-values can yield absolute extrema


# Second Derivative Test

If $f'(c) = 0$  and $f''(c)$ exists

If $f''(c)$ is positive, then $(c, f(c))$ is a minimum
If $f''(c)$ is negative, then $(c, f(c))$ is a maximum
If $f''(c)$ is zero, we don't know, try the [[#First Derivative Test]]

Think of it in terms of parabolas

Useful when given a table because we don't know the first derivative behavior between the given values
