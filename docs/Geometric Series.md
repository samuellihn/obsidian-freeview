The partial sum of a geometric series is, for $n$ terms:

$$S_n = \frac{a_1(1 - r^n)}{1-r}$$

The recursive formula for a geometric series is:

$$\forall n \geq 1, s_n = rs_{n-1}, s_0 = k$$
The explicit (closed) formula is:

$$\forall n \geq 0, s_n = s_0 r^n$$

For the series $2, 4, 8, 16, \dots$:

The sequence be defined as:

$$\forall n \geq 1, s_n = 2s_{n-1}, s_0 = 2$$
