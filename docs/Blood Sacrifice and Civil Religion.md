Argument: Nationalism is the most powerful religion in the United States

Nationalism satisfies some of some of the most traditional definitions of religion

Sectarian and national religion organize killing energy by committing devotees to sacrifice themselves to the group

Religion - a system of cosmological propositions grounded in a belief in a transcendant power expressed through a cult of divine being and giving rise to a set of ethical prescriptions

Many religions regard violence as profane, but some regard killing as a form of commitment - violent and non-violent religions are structurally indistinguishable

Equating nationalism and sectarianism makes both sides angry - sectarianism is a threat to nationalism (induces separating "passions" for the nation) and vice versa (the state is profane to sectarians)

Sectarian faith is optional citizens in a pluralistic nation, and religions are not permitted to kill

However, the national god can exclusively exercise killing power, as this power only belongs to the god

We deny that nationalism is a religion because declaring it a religion would make it contestable, and put it on the same level as sectarian religion - it must be set apart at an even greater level

> Embrace the command not to speak the sacred name of god

The flag - totem of the nation, treated with awe as a sacred object - must be kept whole and perfect

Soldier carries the flag as a sign of willingness to die

War is ritual sacrifice - through death of our soldiers, internal hostilities are discharged and group is unified

Willingness to die - only their own god has the right to kill their own

Totem crisis - occurs when there is uncertainty about essential borders that demarcate our group, what differentiates **us** from **them**

Sacrifice restores totem authority, reconsolidates group

*Ritual victim* - a reason to slaughter members of our group

*Surrogate victim* - used to displace anger at members of our group for slaughter

**Successful ritual sacrifice wipes clean the slate of internal hostilities**

Three characteristics of a **successful** ritual sacrifice:

1. Must touch and affect or seem to touch every member of the group
2. Sacrifice must be willing (or seem to be willing)
3. Victimage must be unanimous - totem secret must be kept (why Vietnam was an unsuccessful sacrifice)
4. Undertaking must pose a serious risk to group survival
5. Outcome must be clear - redefines time, space, and history
6. Another ritual must replace and repair a failed ritual

Media rituals are also (less potent) ways to express and organize group identity - ex. presidential elections

1. The act of group creation is repeated in order to sustain the group
2. Ritual can be opportunistic (wars, etc.) or contrived (preplanned elections
3. Rituals can transform a body or a group or be commemorative, representing blood sacrifice

Imperfect sacrifice risks exposing the totem secret

Cohesion is accomplished within a framework of violence as a structural social force, redistributing our human nature of suffering and violence to keep us together
