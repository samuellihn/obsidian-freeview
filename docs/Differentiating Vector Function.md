The derivative of a [[Vector Function]] is simply the derivative of each component:

> When found at a point, this is called the **tangent vector**

If $r(t) = \langle x(t), y(t) \rangle$, and $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are both differentiable, then

$$
r'(t) = \frac{dr}{dt} = \langle x'(t), y'(t) \rangle = \Big\langle \frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt} \Big\rangle
$$

> This is very similar to [[Differentiating Parametric Equation]]s, except that the answer is expressed as a vector, not a quotient

[[Derivative Rules]] apply, but if we multiply a vector function by a scalar function we need to use the [[Product Rule]]

> When using the product rule, we will get a vector out of it

If taking the derivative of two vectors multiplied together, the [[Product Rule]] can be used, or we can differentiate the resultant function from the [[Dot Product]] of the two vectors (if known)

To take [[Higher Order Derivatives]] take the derivatives of the components as many times as needed
