#APCalcBC #IntegrationIntro 

Used to transform an integral based on the [[Product Rule]]

Usually to integrate two functions multiplied together

$$
\int{u*dv} = u*v  - \int{v*du}
$$

You should **know how to integrate $dv$**

The choice of $u$ should simplify the integrand when differentiated

We are integrating v twice

$$
dv \to v \to \int{v} 
$$

Include the $dx$ into the $dv$

Sometimes, we'll still have to do a [[u Substitution]] (Use $w$ as to not mix up $u$)

 Or, if we get a product in the $\int{v*du}$ term, integration by parts needs to be repeated
