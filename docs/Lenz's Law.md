Used to find the direction of induced current

The sign on [[Faraday's Law]] can be ignored, as Lenz's law can help find the direction of an induced current

Lenz's Law is as follows:

> **The current will be induced in a direction as to minimize the change in [[Magnetic Flux]]**

Very similar to [[Newton's Laws of Motion#First Law of Motion|Newton's First Law]] - just as a mass resists changes to its velocity, conducting hoops resist changes to the magnetic flux inside them by **creating their own flux** to minimize the change

When a magnetic field is changed in a loop and the flux changes, a current will be created in a direction that tries to cancel that change in magnetic flux

In this example, the magnetic field heading downwards is increasing, therefore the magnetic flux downwards is increasing. Therefore, a current will be induced that causes an upwards magnetic flux that tries to counteract the increasing downward flux. This current will be counter-clockwise, according to the right-hand rule.

> Important to consider not only the direction of the magnetic field, but also whether it is increasing or decreasing

If the field is decreasing, the loop will try to counteract the decreasing, by inducing a current that generates flux in the **same direction** as the decreasing field.

Sometimes problems will not explicitly say whether the field is decreasing/increasing, but will say whether a nearby current is decreasing/increasing

Even though the hoop generates a current to try to counteract the change in flux, it always loses - the flux will always change opposite that which is induced by the current.

For problems where we are moving wires to change the flux, Lenz's law agrees with the equation found in [[Force on a Charged Particle in a Magnetic Field]], except that since we're considering the flow of electrons, we use our left hand and negate the result (because of conventional current)

The electrons that flow (induced current) do not need to be inside the magnetic field in order for them to flow - there only needs to be a magnetic field **within the loop**
