$lim_{x\to\infty}{f(x)}$ defines the behavior of the far right of the graph, or the behavior of the graph as $x$ goes toward infinity


This is called **end behavior** of a function

To find end behavior, we analyze the highest-order terms of the function

$$
\frac{6x^2 + 5}{2x^2 + 3x - 1}
$$

Extract the highest-order terms:

$$
\frac{6x^2}{2x^2}
$$

Plug in $x = \infty$:

$$
lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \frac{6}{2} = 3
$$

If the two highest-order terms are the same power, we use the ratio of the coefficients to find the limit

> The horizontal asymptote can be crossed through, it only indicates **end behavior**

If the numerator has a higher order than the denominator, then

$$
lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = \infty
$$

If the denominator has a higher order than the numerator, then

$$
lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = 0
$$

Remember this with  BOB0 BOSCO BOTNO

-   **BO**th the **S**ame -> **CO**efficients
-   **B**igger **O**n **T**op -> **NO** horizontal asymptote


Exponential functions are larger than all powers, and larger bases > smaller bases

End behavior can be used to determine parameters (missing values) in functions
