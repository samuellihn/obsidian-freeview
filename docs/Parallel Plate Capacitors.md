Most basic model of capacitor

![[Pasted image 20220308224655.png]]

Two parallel plates, one positively and one negatively charged with a nonconducting material in the middle

Electric field going from positive to negative
Remember that [[Capacitance]] equals $\frac{Q}{V}$ and voltage of parallel plates is $V = Ed$ ([[Electrical Potential as Path Integral]])
And then because $E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$ ([[Conductors in Electrostatic Equilibrium]]) and $\sigma = \frac{E}{A}$ (charge per area), algebraically manipulate and:

$$
C = \frac{\epsilon_0 A}{d}
$$

> **Only for parallel plate capacitors!**
> The larger the plate is, the more "space" for electrons to build up (and more electrons to lose on other plate)
> The smaller the distance, the built up electrons on the negative plate will help push off electrons on the positive plate, and the lack of electrons on the positive plate will help suck in electrons to the negative plate (two plates will "help" each other)

When power is connected, electrons will build up one one plate and get sucked out of the other (which one depends on polarity of connected battery)

This happens until one plate has too many electrons and one plate has too little 

> When the potential difference between the two plates is equal to the voltage source (According to [[Kirchoff's Loop Rule]])
