The center of mass of any [[Systems|system]] will obey Newton's laws

## First Law of Motion
> Also called the **Law of Inertia**

An object in motion continues to be in motion.  An object which is inert (not in motion) will continue to be inert unless acted upon by an external force

> **Objects resist acceleration**

Every body in an inertial reference frame remains in a state of rest (or constant velocity) unless acted by an external unbalanced force (**friction** counts as an external force)

> The reason we usually need to apply force to keep something moving is because friction is unavoidable

Only valid in an **inertial reference frame**, and the reference frame must **not be accelerating or rotating**

> Example: Inside a moving car, everything appears still

## Second Law of Motion

$$
\sum{F} = ma
$$

Force equals mass times acceleration

> Force is a vector, acceleration is a vector, so mass is a scalar

If two objects are thrown with the same force, the acceleration of the lighter one will be greater

An object does not change its acceleration until a [[Weight]] acts on it

> Don't forget to convert mass into $kg$ if given something else!

## Third Law of Motion
When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal force in the opposite direction of the object - In other words, **every action has an equal and opposite reaction**

> The forces are acting on **different objects**. They should **not** be added as if they were acting on the same body

If object 1 exerts a force on object 2, then object 2 will exert the same force on object 1

$$
F_{1 \ on \ 2} = -F_{2 \ on \ 1}
$$

Action-reaction forces need to be **contact forces**

A force pair is an interaction between two objects - forces within a force pair...
- Always equal in magnitude
- Always the same type of force
- Always in opposite directions
- Always act on different objects
