Some magnetic fields, like those indiuced from a cylindrical wire, not uniform.

Slicing the surface into small slices of $dr$ and calculating the magnetic field that distance $r$ away, which [[Ampere's Law]] tells us the magnetic field a distance $r$ away from a current carrying wire is:

$$
B=  \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}
$$

And then, for each slice of $dr$, the area $da$ is $hdr$

Therefore, our equation for $d\phi$, applying [[Magnetic Flux]] calculation is:

$$
d\phi =\frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r} hdr
$$

Summing up infinitely many $d\phi$, we get:

$$
\phi =\frac{\mu_0 Ih}{2 \pi} \int_a^{a+w}{\frac{dr}{r}}
$$

Integrating and manipulating logarithms, we end up with:

$$
\phi =\frac{\mu_0 Ih}{2 \pi} \ln{\Bigg|\frac{a+w}{a}}\Bigg|
$$

Integrating and manipulating logarithms, we end up with:
