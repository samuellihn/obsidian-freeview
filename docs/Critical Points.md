A **critical point** $c$ is where $f'(c) =0$ or $f'(c)=undefined$
> $f(c)$ needs to exist before it can be considered as a critical point

Critical points "split" the function into different parts
Completely undefined x-values on $f(x)$ are not considered critical values

> Critical **points** need both $x$ and $y$ values: x values only will not be classified as critical points!
> x-values alone are called **critical values**

Sometimes, it is helpful to plot the critical points (zeroes/undefines of the derivative) on a number line (open for undefined, closed for zero)

> Remember, $\frac{0}{0}$ is undefined, not zero

Defined maxima/minima are sometimes considered as included in the intervals of increasing/decreasing, sometimes they are not, it doesn't really matter

Limits to infinity are **never** local maxima/minima
They must go from **increasing to decreasing** or vice versa

Points where the instantaneous rate of change is zero are not considere constant, the function must be constant **over an interval** for it to be considered constant

Critical points can be classified as minima, maxima, neither, or undefined
