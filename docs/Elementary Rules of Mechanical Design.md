**Keep things as simple as possible**

- Fewer components, sizes, moving parts
- Standard parts
- More symmetry

**Keep functions of the design independent of one another**

**Avoid over-constraining a design**

- 4-legged table rocks and teeters
- If it doesn't have to be too rigid, it shouldn't be

**Triangulate parts and structures to make them stiffer**

Bending a part creates high displacement, whereas compression and tension do not

**Consider using tubes instead of solid rods**

Bending stress:

$$
\sigma = \frac{M(x) \times y}{I}
$$
Hollow tubes can handle more bending and torsional stress with less material/weight/cost

**Never overlook the possibility of buckling in parts and structures loaded in compression**

**Hope has no place in design - things must work every time**
