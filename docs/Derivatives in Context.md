A derivative of a function with units will also have units
A helpful way to find out units is to write units in the difference quotient

$$
\frac{4 - 2 \ feet}{2 - 1 \ hour} \rightarrow 2 \frac{feet}{hour}
$$

This can also be applied to units that are rates

$$
\frac{4 - 2 \ \frac{feet^2}{hour}}{2 - 1 \ hour} \rightarrow 2 \ \frac{feet^2}{hour^2}
$$

**Units will always be in $\frac{dependent\ variable}{independent\ variable}$**

### Common Misconceptions
Derivatives are **rates**, not **totals, amounts or averages**
Derivatives are **instantaneous**, not based on **intervals of time**
> at, **not during**

Derivatives are contextual with units, not the units of the original function
> Units of derivatives will almost always be fractions


### Derivative in context template

The $f(t) \ in \ context$ is $increasing/decreasing$ at a **rate** of $f(t) \ with \ units$ at time $t= ?$
