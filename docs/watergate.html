<p>18.6.6</p>
<p>Burglars had tried to break in to the Democratic Party Headquarters at the Watergate complex</p>
<p>Burglars were tried in 1973, one of them [^1] said that Nixon administration had been involved in the break-in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Later publicized by Washington Post, who reported that the burglary attempt was tied to the Nixon administration</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nixon repeatedly asserted innocence, even after his aides had resigned, public disagreed - &#x3C;20% of Americans thought he was honest</p>
<p>Tested relationship between 3 branches of gov't - how far could/would Congress to go prosecute him? What evidence can the courts demand? Does the presidency need to follow the court's decision?</p>
<p>Spiro Agnew resigned in fall 1973, Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to become his new VP [^2]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Made Nixon more vulnerable to impeachment because Gerald Ford, the new Vice President, was actually viable as President</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was revealed that Nixon was secretly taping Oval Office conversations, so people thought these conversations might contain information to make him guilty</p>
<p>Nixon refused to turn the tapes over to the prosecutor, claiming executive privilege</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Executive Privilege:</strong> President has the right to keep certain information confidential</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supreme court ruled in <em>United States v. Nixon</em> that the tapes didn't fall under executive privilege and ordered Nixon to turn the tapes over</p>
<p>Tapes were missing crucial information but still enough for the House to vote on impeachment, charged Nixon with:</p>
<ul>
<li>obstruction of justice</li>
<li>misuse of power</li>
<li>refusal to comply with House subpeona</li>
</ul>
<p>Nixon recognized that he might be voted into trial and convicted, so he resigned on August 9, 1974</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still unknown of Nixon's involvement in the burglary, but almost certain that Nixon took part in the cover-up<br>
Investigations also reveal that Nixon had abused presidential power other ways in securing reelection</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Damaged reputation of presidency and made the public less confident in the government</p>
<p>% of Americans who believed that government statements were true went from 80 to 33%</p>
<p>Congress passed reforms to restore public confidence</p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Election Campaign Act limited money individuals could give to political candidates to limit corruption</li>
<li>Made procedure for naming counsel to investigate charges against White House</li>
</ul>
<p>Also showed that nation could go through a crisis and that checks and balances worked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress and Supreme Court checked power of the president</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Demonstrated that not even the president can be above the law</p>
