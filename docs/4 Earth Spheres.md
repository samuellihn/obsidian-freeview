Earth's surface
- Rocks

# Hydrosphere

Layer of water (all types and forms, clouds, ice, etc.)

# Atmosphere

Layer of air surrounding earth

Gases and small particles (dust)

Most commonly $N_2$, $O_2$ $CO_2$, water vapor, dust

# Biosphere

Layer of Earth where living organisms are found

Only 12 miles thick - very bottoms of seas to very tops of tallest mountains

**No one species is completely indepenent** - for life to exist, there must be more than one species

This is the concept of an [[Ecosystem]] - interdependence among everything

The lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere contain the materials needed to support the biosphere - called **environmental unity**
