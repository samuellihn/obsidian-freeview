Surface can be blocked by adsorption of a non-binding protein like BSA, which makes patterned cells that cells can grow on

However, photoreist still needs to be removed with acetone (which proteins don't like)

## Soft lithography

Based around molding PDMS - moldable elastober - moldable, deformable, unreactive, hydrophobic (but can be selectively made hydrophilic), insulating - basically a silicone rubber

Build relief structure out of photoresist, pour PDMS on top, which then creates a PDMS stamp

Photoresist relief layer can even be reused

Can be used with self-assembled nonlayers (SAM), which self-assemble on a substrate because of Van-der-waals forces 

Two types of SAM - Alkanethiolates - silicon at one end, covalent bond to noble metals

Akylsilanes - silicon and hydroxyl groups at the end, cross-link to SiO2

Can pattern SAMs using microcontact printing

1. Create PDMS stamp (see above)
2. Apply SAM solution, coat stamp with SAM solution
3. Bring this in contact with substrate, only the protruding parts of the stamp get transferred

PDMS can be exposed to oxygen plasma, turn the surface into glass, which can then bond to another PDMS, or glass, silicon, LDPE, etc. - this is how microfluidic channels are created

Micromixer using microfluidic channels -

Creates a concentration gradient (because of the pattern of the microchannels)

Can create mechanical force-sensing components with PDMS as well

PDMS can be used for valves, peristaltic pump - manipulate fluids on a chip with magnetic pumping

Can create integrated fluidic chips, just liike integrated circuit chips - fluidic RAM
