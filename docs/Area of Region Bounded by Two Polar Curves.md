The area of a region bounded by two polar curves is the area bounded by the outer curve minus the area bounded by the inner curve

Unlike the rectangular [[Area Between Curves]], we need to apply the [[Area of Polar Region]] equation before taking the integral

$$
dA = \frac{1}{2}r^2 d\theta
$$

Also, it may be helpful to divide a given region up into sub-regions, determine an integral for the regions, then add or subtract these regions to get the final answer
